Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a desktop puzzle game based on the mathematical problem known as the "Knight's Tour". In this game, the player controls a chess knight, and the objective is to move the knight across a chessboard (or any m x n grid) so that it visits every square exactly once. The challenge increases with the size of the board, and the game can offer various levels of difficulty. The knight moves in an L-shape, as it does in traditional chess

The code is missing the import statements for the classes `Board` and `Knight` in the `game.py` file. These classes are being used in the `Game` class but are not imported. To fix this, add the following import statements at the top of the `game.py` file:

```python

Additionally, the `Knight` class in `knight.py` is missing the `self.board` parameter in its constructor. To fix this, update the `Knight` class constructor in `knight.py` as follows:

```python
def __init__(self, board):
    self.board = board
    self.current_row = 0
    self.current_col = 0
```

Once these changes are made, the code should be able to run without any errors.

<SUGGESTION>
Please add the necessary import statements and update the `Knight` class constructor as mentioned above.

 <COMMENT>
The code is missing the import statements for the classes `Board` and `Knight` in the `game.py` file. These classes are being used in the `Game` class but are not imported. To fix this, add the following import statements at the top of the `game.py` file:

```python
from board import Board
from knight import Knight
```

Additionally, the `Knight` class in `knight.py` is missing the `self.board` parameter in its constructor. To fix this, update the `Knight` class constructor in `knight.py` as follows:

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code is missing the import statements for the classes `Board` and `Knight` in the `game.py` file. These classes are being used in the `Game` class but are not imported. To fix this, add the following import statements at the top of the `game.py` file:

```python
from board import Board
from knight import Knight
```

Additionally, the `Knight` class in `knight.py` is missing the `self.board` parameter in its constructor. To fix this, update the `Knight` class constructor in `knight.py` as follows:

```python
def __init__(self, board):
    self.board = board
    self.current_row = 0
    self.current_col = 0
```

Once these changes are made, the code should be able to run without any errors.

<SUGGESTION>
Please add the necessary import statements and update the `Knight` class constructor as mentioned above."

In this game, the player controls a chess knight, and the objective is to move the knight across a chessboard (or any m x n grid) so that it visits every square exactly once. The challenge increases with the size of the board, and the game can offer various levels of difficulty. The knight moves in an L-shape, as it does in traditional chess REQ1 User interface: Main menu: Start Game: Begins a new game. Players can select the difficulty level or board size here. REQ2 User interface: Main menu: Options/Settings: Allows players to customize game settings, including sound volume, visual themes, and knight/chessboard appearances. REQ3 User interface: Main menu: Tutorial: A brief interactive or video tutorial on how the game is played, detailing the knight's legal moves. REQ4 User interface: Main menu: High Scores: Displays a list of high scores, possibly with filters for different board sizes. REQ5 User interface: Main menu: Exit: Quits the game. REQ6 User interface: Game window: Chessboard/Grid Display: Centrally displays the game board with a clear distinction between visited and unvisited squares. The current position of the knight is highlighted. REQ7 User interface: Game window: Move Counter: Shows the number of moves made by the player.

<COMMENT>
In the `Game` class in `game.py`, the `start` method is not correctly initializing the `Board` and `Knight` objects. It is using the `self.board` and `self.knight` attributes which are not yet initialized. This will result in an error when trying to draw the board or knight.

To fix this, you need to initialize the `Board` and `Knight` objects before using them. Here's the revised code for the `start` method:

```python
def start(self):
    difficulty = self.board.select_difficulty()
    self.board = Board(self.board.master, difficulty)
    self.knight = Knight(self.board)
    self.board.draw()
    self.knight.draw()
```

Please make this change in the `start` method of the `Game` class in `game.py`.

Once you make this change, the initialization of the `Board` and `Knight` objects will be correct and the game should start without any errors.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
In the `Game` class in `game.py`, the `start` method is not correctly initializing the `Board` and `Knight` objects. It is using the `self.board` and `self.knight` attributes which are not yet initialized. This will result in an error when trying to draw the board or knight.

To fix this, you need to initialize the `Board` and `Knight` objects before using them. Here's the revised code for the `start` method:

```python
def start(self):
    difficulty = self.board.select_difficulty()
    self.board = Board(self.board.master, difficulty)
    self.knight = Knight(self.board)
    self.board.draw()
    self.knight.draw()
```

Please make this change in the `start` method of the `Game` class in `game.py`.

Once you make this change, the initialization of the `Board` and `Knight` objects will be correct and the game should start without any errors.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

In this game, the player controls a chess knight, and the objective is to move the knight across a chessboard (or any m x n grid) so that it visits every square exactly once. The challenge increases with the size of the board, and the game can offer various levels of difficulty. The knight moves in an L-shape, as it does in traditional chess

<COMMENT>
The code is missing the implementation of the "Options/Settings" functionality mentioned in REQ2. This functionality should allow players to customize game settings, including sound volume, visual themes, and knight/chessboard appearances.

<SUGGESTION>
To implement the "Options/Settings" functionality, you can add a new class called "Settings" that handles the customization options. This class can have methods to adjust sound volume, change visual themes, and modify knight/chessboard appearances. Additionally, you can add a new option in the main menu to access the settings menu.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code is missing the implementation of the "Options/Settings" functionality mentioned in REQ2. This functionality should allow players to customize game settings, including sound volume, visual themes, and knight/chessboard appearances.

<SUGGESTION>
To implement the "Options/Settings" functionality, you can add a new class called "Settings" that handles the customization options. This class can have methods to adjust sound volume, change visual themes, and modify knight/chessboard appearances. Additionally, you can add a new option in the main menu to access the settings menu."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: To specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly, you can create a requirements.txt file in the following format:
requirements.txt
```
tkinter==8.6
```
In this case, the only dependency required for the project is the tkinter package, which is used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) in Python. The version specified is 8.6, but you can adjust it based on the version of tkinter that you have installed or prefer to use. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:
