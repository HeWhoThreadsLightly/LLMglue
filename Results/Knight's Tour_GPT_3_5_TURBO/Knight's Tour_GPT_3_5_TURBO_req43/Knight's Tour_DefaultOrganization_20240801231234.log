<COMMENT>
The code is missing the implementation of the `get_hint()` method in the `Game` class. This method is called when the player requests a hint, but it is not defined in the code. To fix this, you need to add the `get_hint()` method to the `Game` class in the `game.py` file.

Here's an example implementation of the `get_hint()` method:

```python
def get_hint(self):
    if self.is_paused or self.is_completed:
        return None
    # Get the current position of the knight
    current_row, current_col = self.knight.current_row, self.knight.current_col
    # Get the list of unvisited squares on the board
    unvisited_squares = []
    for row in range(self.board.size):
        for col in range(self.board.size):
            if not self.board.is_visited(row, col):
                unvisited_squares.append((row, col))
    # Calculate the distances from the current position to each unvisited square
    distances = []
    for square in unvisited_squares:
        row, col = square
        distance = abs(row - current_row) + abs(col - current_col)
        distances.append(distance)
    # Find the square with the minimum distance
    min_distance = min(distances)
    min_distance_index = distances.index(min_distance)
    hint_square = unvisited_squares[min_distance_index]
    # Update the game state
    self.move_counter += 1
    self.board.mark_visited(hint_square[0], hint_square[1])
    # Display a message to the player
    messagebox.showinfo("Hint", f"The next move is to square {hint_square[0] + 1}, {hint_square[1] + 1}.")
    # Return the hint square
    return hint_square
```

Once you have added the `get_hint()` method, the hint functionality should work correctly in the game.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code is missing the implementation of the `get_hint()` method in the `Game` class. This method is called when the player requests a hint, but it is not defined in the code. To fix this, you need to add the `get_hint()` method to the `Game` class in the `game.py` file.

Here's an example implementation of the `get_hint()` method:

```python
def get_hint(self):
    if self.is_paused or self.is_completed:
        return None
    # Get the current position of the knight
    current_row, current_col = self.knight.current_row, self.knight.current_col
    # Get the list of unvisited squares on the board
    unvisited_squares = []
    for row in range(self.board.size):
        for col in range(self.board.size):
            if not self.board.is_visited(row, col):
                unvisited_squares.append((row, col))
    # Calculate the distances from the current position to each unvisited square
    distances = []
    for square in unvisited_squares:
        row, col = square
        distance = abs(row - current_row) + abs(col - current_col)
        distances.append(distance)
    # Find the square with the minimum distance
    min_distance = min(distances)
    min_distance_index = distances.index(min_distance)
    hint_square = unvisited_squares[min_distance_index]
    # Update the game state
    self.move_counter += 1
    self.board.mark_visited(hint_square[0], hint_square[1])
    # Display a message to the player
    messagebox.showinfo("Hint", f"The next move is to square {hint_square[0] + 1}, {hint_square[1] + 1}.")
    # Return the hint square
    return hint_square
```

Once you have added the `get_hint()` method, the hint functionality should work correctly in the game."

Here is a new customer's task: Develop a desktop puzzle game based on the mathematical problem known as the "Knight's Tour". In this game, the player controls a chess knight, and the objective is to move the knight across a chessboard (or any m x n grid) so that it visits every square exactly once. The challenge increases with the size of the board, and the game can offer various levels of difficulty. The knight moves in an L-shape, as it does in traditional chess

REQ12 User Interface: Options/Settings Window: Visual Settings: Options to change the theme of the chessboard and the knight. This could include color schemes or graphical styles. REQ13 User Interface: Options/Settings Window: Difficulty Settings: Allows users to choose the size of the chessboard, affecting the difficulty. The window might also offer toggles for advanced features like the timer. REQ14 User interface: High scores window: Score List: Displays a list of high scores, with details such as player name, score (based on moves and time), and board size. REQ15 User interface: High scores window: Filters: Allows users to filter scores by board size or difficulty level. REQ16 User interface: Tutorial window: Interactive Tutorial: A step-by-step guide that introduces the player to the game mechanics, including how the knight moves, the objective of the game, and any unique features (e.g., hints, undos). REQ17 User Interface: Pause Menu (In-Game): Resume Game: Returns to the game. REQ18 User Interface: Pause Menu (In-Game): Restart Game: Starts a new game with the same settings. REQ19 User Interface: Pause Menu (In-Game): Settings: Opens the Options/Settings window.

REQ22 Additional feature requirements: Game mechanics: Prevent the knight from visiting a square more than once. REQ23 Additional feature requirements: Game mechanics: Detect when the player has successfully completed the tour or if the tour is no longer possible to complete. REQ24 Additional feature requirements: Levels and challenges: Offer boards of different sizes (e.g., 8x8, 6x6, 10x10) to cater to various levels of difficulty. REQ25 Additional feature requirements: Levels and challenges: Include a timer and move counter to challenge players to complete the puzzle faster or in fewer moves. REQ26 Additional feature requirements: Scoring and progression: Implement a scoring system based on the time taken to complete the tour, and the difficulty level of the board. REQ27 Additional feature requirements: Scoring and progression: Save high scores and player progress. REQ28 Additional feature requirements: Tutorials and hints: Provide a brief interactive tutorial on how to play the game and move the knight. REQ29 Additional feature requirements: Tutorials and hints: Offer hints or allow users to undo moves to help beginners. REQ30 Additional feature requirements: Customization and preferences: Allow players to customize the appearance of the chessboard and the knight. REQ31 Additional feature requirements: Customization and preferences: Options to mute sounds or music. REQ32 Accessibility requirements: Keyboard navigation: Full functionality should be accessible via keyboard shortcuts to ensure that users who cannot use a mouse can navigate efficiently through the application. REQ33 Accessibility requirements: Keyboard navigation: Implement tab navigation through all interactive elements in a logical order.

<COMMENT>
The code is missing the implementation of the `GameWindow` class. This class is responsible for handling user interactions in the game window, such as moving the knight, undoing moves, showing hints, and pausing the game. It also needs to create the game window, display the chessboard, and update the move counter.

To fix this, you need to implement the `GameWindow` class and its methods according to the requirements. You should also update the `start()` method in the `Game` class to create an instance of the `GameWindow` class and start the game.

Here is an example implementation of the `GameWindow` class:

```python
class GameWindow:
    def __init__(self, game, board, knight):
        self.game = game
        self.board = board
        self.knight = knight
        self.move_counter = 0
        self.is_paused = False
        self.is_completed = False

    def move_knight(self, row, col):
        if self.is_paused or self.is_completed:
            return
        self.move_counter += 1
        self.game.move_knight(row, col)
        self.update_move_counter()

    def undo_move(self):
        if self.is_paused or self.is_completed:
            return
        self.move_counter -= 1
        self.game.undo()
        self.update_move_counter()

    def show_hint(self):
        if self.is_paused or self.is_completed:
            return
        self.game.show_hint()

    def update_move_counter(self):
        self.move_counter_label.config(text=f"Moves: {self.move_counter}")

    def toggle_pause(self):
        self.is_paused = not self.is_paused
        if self.is_paused:
            self.pause_button.config(text="Resume")
        else:
            self.pause_button.config(text="Pause")

    def open_menu(self):
        if self.is_paused or self.is_completed:
            return
        self.toggle_pause()  # Pause the game

        menu_window.title("Menu")
        menu_window.geometry("200x200")

        restart_button = tk.Button(menu_window, text="Restart Game", command=self.restart_game)
        restart_button.pack()

    def return_to_main_menu(self):
        self.window.destroy()  # Close the game window
        self.game.board.master.deiconify()  # Show the main menu window

    def restart_game(self):
        self.window.destroy()  # Close the game window
        self.game.start()  # Start a new game
        self.create_game_window()  # Create a new game window
        self.toggle_pause()  # Initialize the game as not paused

    def create_game_window(self):
        self.window = tk.Toplevel()
        self.window.title("Knight's Tour")
        self.window.geometry("400x450")

        self.board_frame = tk.Frame(self.window)
        self.board_frame.pack()

        self.move_counter_label = tk.Label(self.window, text="Moves: 0")
        self.move_counter_label.pack()

        self.undo_button = tk.Button(self.window, text="Undo", command=self.undo_move)
        self.undo_button.pack()

        self.hint_button = tk.Button(self.window, text="Hint", command=self.show_hint)
        self.hint_button.pack()

        self.pause_button = tk.Button(self.window, text="Pause/Menu", command=self.open_menu)
        self.pause_button.pack()

        self.board.canvas = tk.Canvas(self.board_frame, width=400, height=400)
        self.board.canvas.pack()

        self.board.draw()
        self.knight.draw()

        self.board.canvas.bind("<Button-1>", self.handle_board_click)

    def handle_board_click(self, event):
        if self.is_paused or self.is_completed:
            return

        row = event.y // self.board.square_size
        col = event.x // self.board.square_size

        if self.board.is_valid_move(row, col):
            if not self.board.is_visited(row, col):
                self.move_knight(row, col)
                self.update_move_counter()  # Update the move counter label
            else:
                messagebox.showerror("Invalid Move", "This square has already been visited! Please select a different square.")
        else:
            messagebox.showerror("Invalid Move", "Invalid move! Please select a valid move.")

    def start(self):
        self.game.start()
        self.create_game_window()
        self.toggle_pause()  # Initialize the game as not paused
        self.window.mainloop()
```

You also need to update the `start()` method in the `Game` class to create an instance of the `GameWindow` class and start the game:

```python
def start(self):
    self.board = Board(self.board.master, self.board.difficulty, self.settings)
    self.knight = Knight(self.board)
    self.board.draw()
    self.knight.draw()
    self.move_counter = 0
    self.is_paused = False
    self.is_completed = False

    game_window = GameWindow(self, self.board, self.knight)
    game_window.start()
```

Once you have implemented the `GameWindow` class and updated the `start()` method in the `Game` class, the game should be fully functional and meet the requirements.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code is missing the implementation of the `GameWindow` class. This class is responsible for handling user interactions in the game window, such as moving the knight, undoing moves, showing hints, and pausing the game. It also needs to create the game window, display the chessboard, and update the move counter.

To fix this, you need to implement the `GameWindow` class and its methods according to the requirements. You should also update the `start()` method in the `Game` class to create an instance of the `GameWindow` class and start the game.

Here is an example implementation of the `GameWindow` class:

```python
class GameWindow:
    def __init__(self, game, board, knight):
        self.game = game
        self.board = board
        self.knight = knight
        self.move_counter = 0
        self.is_paused = False
        self.is_completed = False

    def move_knight(self, row, col):
        if self.is_paused or self.is_completed:
            return
        self.move_counter += 1
        self.game.move_knight(row, col)
        self.update_move_counter()

    def undo_move(self):
        if self.is_paused or self.is_completed:
            return
        self.move_counter -= 1
        self.game.undo()
        self.update_move_counter()

    def show_hint(self):
        if self.is_paused or self.is_completed:
            return
        self.game.show_hint()

    def update_move_counter(self):
        self.move_counter_label.config(text=f"Moves: {self.move_counter}")

    def toggle_pause(self):
        self.is_paused = not self.is_paused
        if self.is_paused:
            self.pause_button.config(text="Resume")
        else:
            self.pause_button.config(text="Pause")

    def open_menu(self):
        if self.is_paused or self.is_completed:
            return
        self.toggle_pause()  # Pause the game
        menu_window = tk.Toplevel(self.window)
        menu_window.title("Menu")
        menu_window.geometry("200x200")
        settings_button = tk.Button(menu_window, text="Settings", command=self.game.settings.customize_settings)
        settings_button.pack()
        main_menu_button = tk.Button(menu_window, text="Return to Main Menu", command=self.return_to_main_menu)
        main_menu_button.pack()
        restart_button = tk.Button(menu_window, text="Restart Game", command=self.restart_game)
        restart_button.pack()

    def return_to_main_menu(self):
        self.window.destroy()  # Close the game window
        self.game.board.master.deiconify()  # Show the main menu window

    def restart_game(self):
        self.window.destroy()  # Close the game window
        self.game.start()  # Start a new game
        self.create_game_window()  # Create a new game window
        self.toggle_pause()  # Initialize the game as not paused

    def create_game_window(self):
        self.window = tk.Toplevel()
        self.window.title("Knight's Tour")
        self.window.geometry("400x450")

        self.board_frame = tk.Frame(self.window)
        self.board_frame.pack()

        self.move_counter_label = tk.Label(self.window, text="Moves: 0")
        self.move_counter_label.pack()

        self.undo_button = tk.Button(self.window, text="Undo", command=self.undo_move)
        self.undo_button.pack()

        self.hint_button = tk.Button(self.window, text="Hint", command=self.show_hint)
        self.hint_button.pack()

        self.pause_button = tk.Button(self.window, text="Pause/Menu", command=self.open_menu)
        self.pause_button.pack()

        self.board.canvas = tk.Canvas(self.board_frame, width=400, height=400)
        self.board.canvas.pack()

        self.board.draw()
        self.knight.draw()

        self.board.canvas.bind("<Button-1>", self.handle_board_click)

    def handle_board_click(self, event):
        if self.is_paused or self.is_completed:
            return

        row = event.y // self.board.square_size
        col = event.x // self.board.square_size

        if self.board.is_valid_move(row, col):
            if not self.board.is_visited(row, col):
                self.move_knight(row, col)
                self.update_move_counter()  # Update the move counter label
            else:
                messagebox.showerror("Invalid Move", "This square has already been visited! Please select a different square.")
        else:
            messagebox.showerror("Invalid Move", "Invalid move! Please select a valid move.")

    def start(self):
        self.game.start()
        self.create_game_window()
        self.toggle_pause()  # Initialize the game as not paused
        self.window.mainloop()
```

You also need to update the `start()` method in the `Game` class to create an instance of the `GameWindow` class and start the game:

```python
def start(self):
    self.board = Board(self.board.master, self.board.difficulty, self.settings)
    self.knight = Knight(self.board)
    self.board.draw()
    self.knight.draw()
    self.move_counter = 0
    self.is_paused = False
    self.is_completed = False

    game_window = GameWindow(self, self.board, self.knight)
    game_window.start()
```

Once you have implemented the `GameWindow` class and updated the `start()` method in the `Game` class, the game should be fully functional and meet the requirements."

The highest priority comment is related to the implementation of the "get_hint" method in the Game class. Currently, the method returns the hint square, but it does not update the game state by marking the hint square as visited. This can lead to incorrect behavior when the player makes a move after receiving a hint.

To fix this issue, you need to add the code to mark the hint square as visited in the "get_hint" method. Here's the revised code for the "get_hint" method:

```python
def get_hint(self):
    if self.is_paused or self.is_completed:
        return None
    # Get the current position of the knight
    current_row, current_col = self.knight.current_row, self.knight.current_col
    # Get the list of unvisited squares on the board
    unvisited_squares = []
    for row in range(self.board.size):
        for col in range(self.board.size):
            if not self.board.is_visited(row, col):
                unvisited_squares.append((row, col))
    # Calculate the distances from the current position to each unvisited square
    distances = []
    for square in unvisited_squares:
        row, col = square
        distance = abs(row - current_row) + abs(col - current_col)
        distances.append(distance)
    # Find the square with the minimum distance
    min_distance = min(distances)
    min_distance_index = distances.index(min_distance)
    hint_square = unvisited_squares[min_distance_index]
    # Update the game state
    self.move_history.append(hint_square)
    self.board.mark_visited(hint_square[0], hint_square[1])
    # Display a message to the player
    messagebox.showinfo("Hint", f"The next move is to square {hint_square[0] + 1}, {hint_square[1] + 1}.")
    # Return the hint square
    return hint_square
```

After making this change, the hint square will be correctly marked as visited when the player receives a hint.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the implementation of the "get_hint" method in the Game class. Currently, the method returns the hint square, but it does not update the game state by marking the hint square as visited. This can lead to incorrect behavior when the player makes a move after receiving a hint.

To fix this issue, you need to add the code to mark the hint square as visited in the "get_hint" method. Here's the revised code for the "get_hint" method:

```python
def get_hint(self):
    if self.is_paused or self.is_completed:
        return None
    # Get the current position of the knight
    current_row, current_col = self.knight.current_row, self.knight.current_col
    # Get the list of unvisited squares on the board
    unvisited_squares = []
    for row in range(self.board.size):
        for col in range(self.board.size):
            if not self.board.is_visited(row, col):
                unvisited_squares.append((row, col))
    # Calculate the distances from the current position to each unvisited square
    distances = []
    for square in unvisited_squares:
        row, col = square
        distance = abs(row - current_row) + abs(col - current_col)
        distances.append(distance)
    # Find the square with the minimum distance
    min_distance = min(distances)
    min_distance_index = distances.index(min_distance)
    hint_square = unvisited_squares[min_distance_index]
    # Update the game state
    self.move_history.append(hint_square)
    self.board.mark_visited(hint_square[0], hint_square[1])
    # Display a message to the player
    messagebox.showinfo("Hint", f"The next move is to square {hint_square[0] + 1}, {hint_square[1] + 1}.")
    # Return the hint square
    return hint_square
```

After making this change, the hint square will be correctly marked as visited when the player receives a hint."

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)
