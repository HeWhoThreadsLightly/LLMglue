## 3. How to Play

### Game Window
Once you start a new game, the game window will open. It will display the chessboard/grid, the current position of the knight, a move counter, and optional features such as a timer, undo button, and hint button.

### Moving the Knight
To move the knight, click on a valid square on the chessboard. A valid move is one that follows the knight's L-shaped movement pattern and has not been visited before. The game will update the move counter and highlight the current position of the knight.

### Undoing a Move
If you make a mistake, you can use the undo button to revert the last move. Note that the undo button may have a limited number of uses.

### Getting a Hint
If you need help, you can use the hint button to get a hint for the next move. The hint feature may also be limited to ensure the game remains challenging.
