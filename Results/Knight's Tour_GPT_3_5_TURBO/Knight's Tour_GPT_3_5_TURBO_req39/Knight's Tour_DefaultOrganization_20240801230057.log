<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the `Knight` class's `draw` method. This method is responsible for drawing the knight on the game board. To fix this, you need to add the implementation of the `draw` method in the `knight.py` file.

Here's the revised code for the `Knight` class:

```python
import tkinter as tk

class Knight:
    def __init__(self, board):
        self.board = board
        self.current_row = 0
        self.current_col = 0

    def draw(self):
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = self.board.get_square_coordinates(self.current_row, self.current_col)
        self.board.canvas.create_oval(x1, y1, x2, y2, fill="blue")

    def move_knight(self, row, col):
        self.current_row = row
        self.current_col = col
        self.draw()
```

Please add this revised code to the `knight.py` file and ensure that the `draw` method is implemented correctly.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the `Knight` class's `draw` method. This method is responsible for drawing the knight on the game board. To fix this, you need to add the implementation of the `draw` method in the `knight.py` file.

Here's the revised code for the `Knight` class:

```python

In this game, the player controls a chess knight, and the objective is to move the knight across a chessboard (or any m x n grid) so that it visits every square exactly once. The challenge increases with the size of the board, and the game can offer various levels of difficulty. The knight moves in an L-shape, as it does in traditional chess REQ1 User interface: Main menu: Start Game: Begins a new game. Players can select the difficulty level or board size here. REQ2 User interface: Main menu: Options/Settings: Allows players to customize game settings, including sound volume, visual themes, and knight/chessboard appearances. REQ3 User interface: Main menu: Tutorial: A brief interactive or video tutorial on how the game is played, detailing the knight's legal moves. REQ4 User interface: Main menu: High Scores: Displays a list of high scores, possibly with filters for different board sizes. REQ5 User interface: Main menu: Exit: Quits the game. REQ6 User interface: Game window: Chessboard/Grid Display: Centrally displays the game board with a clear distinction between visited and unvisited squares. The current position of the knight is highlighted. REQ7 User interface: Game window: Move Counter: Shows the number of moves made by the player. REQ8 User interface: Game window: Timer: (Optional) A timer showing how long the player has been attempting the current puzzle. REQ9 User interface: Game window: Undo Button: Allows the player to undo the last move. This could be limited to a certain number of uses.

REQ13 User Interface: Options/Settings Window: Difficulty Settings: Allows users to choose the size of the chessboard, affecting the difficulty. The window might also offer toggles for advanced features like the timer. REQ14 User interface: High scores window: Score List: Displays a list of high scores, with details such as player name, score (based on moves and time), and board size. REQ15 User interface: High scores window: Filters: Allows users to filter scores by board size or difficulty level. REQ16 User interface: Tutorial window: Interactive Tutorial: A step-by-step guide that introduces the player to the game mechanics, including how the knight moves, the objective of the game, and any unique features (e.g., hints, undos).

<COMMENT>
In the `Game` class in game.py, the `start()` method is missing an implementation. This method is responsible for starting a new game by initializing the board, knight, move counter, and other game-related variables. It should also create the game window and handle user interactions.

To fix this, you need to implement the `start()` method in the `Game` class. Here's a suggested implementation:

```python
def start(self):
    difficulty = self.board.select_difficulty()
    self.board = Board(self.board.master, difficulty, self.settings)
    self.knight = Knight(self.board)
    self.board.draw()
    self.knight.draw()
    self.move_counter = 0
    self.is_paused = False
    self.is_completed = False
```

This implementation prompts the user to select the difficulty level, creates a new board and knight based on the selected difficulty, and initializes the move counter and game state variables.

Once you've implemented the `start()` method, the game should be able to start a new game with the selected difficulty level.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
In the `Game` class in game.py, the `start()` method is missing an implementation. This method is responsible for starting a new game by initializing the board, knight, move counter, and other game-related variables. It should also create the game window and handle user interactions.

To fix this, you need to implement the `start()` method in the `Game` class. Here's a suggested implementation:

```python
def start(self):
    difficulty = self.board.select_difficulty()
    self.board = Board(self.board.master, difficulty, self.settings)
    self.knight = Knight(self.board)
    self.board.draw()
    self.knight.draw()
    self.move_counter = 0
    self.is_paused = False
    self.is_completed = False

This implementation prompts the user to select the difficulty level, creates a new board and knight based on the selected difficulty, and initializes the move counter and game state variables.

Once you've implemented the `start()` method, the game should be able to start a new game with the selected difficulty level."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

In this game, the player controls a chess knight, and the objective is to move the knight across a chessboard (or any m x n grid) so that it visits every square exactly once. The challenge increases with the size of the board, and the game can offer various levels of difficulty. The knight moves in an L-shape, as it does in traditional chess REQ1 User interface: Main menu: Start Game: Begins a new game. Players can select the difficulty level or board size here. REQ2 User interface: Main menu: Options/Settings: Allows players to customize game settings, including sound volume, visual themes, and knight/chessboard appearances. REQ3 User interface: Main menu: Tutorial: A brief interactive or video tutorial on how the game is played, detailing the knight's legal moves. REQ4 User interface: Main menu: High Scores: Displays a list of high scores, possibly with filters for different board sizes. REQ5 User interface: Main menu: Exit: Quits the game. REQ6 User interface: Game window: Chessboard/Grid Display: Centrally displays the game board with a clear distinction between visited and unvisited squares. The current position of the knight is highlighted. REQ7 User interface: Game window: Move Counter: Shows the number of moves made by the player. REQ8 User interface: Game window: Timer: (Optional) A timer showing how long the player has been attempting the current puzzle. REQ9 User interface: Game window: Undo Button: Allows the player to undo the last move. This could be limited to a certain number of uses.

REQ12 User Interface: Options/Settings Window: Visual Settings: Options to change the theme of the chessboard and the knight. This could include color schemes or graphical styles. REQ13 User Interface: Options/Settings Window: Difficulty Settings: Allows users to choose the size of the chessboard, affecting the difficulty. The window might also offer toggles for advanced features like the timer. REQ14 User interface: High scores window: Score List: Displays a list of high scores, with details such as player name, score (based on moves and time), and board size. REQ15 User interface: High scores window: Filters: Allows users to filter scores by board size or difficulty level. REQ16 User interface: Tutorial window: Interactive Tutorial: A step-by-step guide that introduces the player to the game mechanics, including how the knight moves, the objective of the game, and any unique features (e.g., hints, undos). REQ17 User Interface: Pause Menu (In-Game): Resume Game: Returns to the game. REQ18 User Interface: Pause Menu (In-Game): Restart Game: Starts a new game with the same settings.

<COMMENT>
The code is missing the implementation of the `Settings` class methods `adjust_sound_volume`, `change_visual_theme`, `modify_knight_appearance`, `modify_chessboard_appearance`, `show_settings`, and `customize_settings`. These methods are necessary for the functionality of the game settings.

<SUGGESTION>
To fix this, you need to implement the missing methods in the `Settings` class. Here's an example of how you can implement these methods:

```python
class Settings:
    def __init__(self, master):
        self.master = master
        self.sound_volume = 50
        self.visual_theme = "Default"
        self.knight_appearance = "Default"
        self.chessboard_appearance = "Default"
        self.visited_square_appearance = "LightGray"

    def adjust_sound_volume(self, volume):
        self.sound_volume = volume

    def change_visual_theme(self, theme):
        self.visual_theme = theme

    def modify_knight_appearance(self, appearance):
        self.knight_appearance = appearance

    def modify_chessboard_appearance(self, appearance):
        self.chessboard_appearance = appearance

    def show_settings(self):
        messagebox.showinfo("Settings",
                            f"Sound Volume: {self.sound_volume}\nVisual Theme: {self.visual_theme}\nKnight Appearance: {self.knight_appearance}\nChessboard Appearance: {self.chessboard_appearance}")

    def customize_settings(self):
        options = ["Adjust Sound Volume", "Change Visual Theme", "Modify Knight Appearance", "Modify Chessboard Appearance"]
        choice = sd.askoption("Customize Settings", "Select an option", options=options, parent=self.master)
        if choice == "Adjust Sound Volume":
            volume = sd.askinteger("Adjust Sound Volume", "Enter sound volume (0-100)", minvalue=0, maxvalue=100, initialvalue=self.sound_volume, parent=self.master)
            self.adjust_sound_volume(volume)
        elif choice == "Change Visual Theme":
            theme = sd.askstring("Change Visual Theme", "Enter visual theme", initialvalue=self.visual_theme, parent=self.master)
            self.change_visual_theme(theme)
        elif choice == "Modify Knight Appearance":
            appearance = sd.askstring("Modify Knight Appearance", "Enter knight appearance", initialvalue=self.knight_appearance, parent=self.master)
            self.modify_knight_appearance(appearance)
        elif choice == "Modify Chessboard Appearance":
            appearance = sd.askstring("Modify Chessboard Appearance", "Enter chessboard appearance", initialvalue=self.chessboard_appearance, parent=self.master)
            self.modify_chessboard_appearance(appearance)
```

Once you have implemented these methods, the game settings functionality should work as expected.

Task: "Develop a desktop puzzle game based on the mathematical problem known as the "Knight's Tour". In this game, the player controls a chess knight, and the objective is to move the knight across a chessboard (or any m x n grid) so that it visits every square exactly once. The challenge increases with the size of the board, and the game can offer various levels of difficulty. The knight moves in an L-shape, as it does in traditional chess

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code is missing the implementation of the `Settings` class methods `adjust_sound_volume`, `change_visual_theme`, `modify_knight_appearance`, `modify_chessboard_appearance`, `show_settings`, and `customize_settings`. These methods are necessary for the functionality of the game settings.

<SUGGESTION>
To fix this, you need to implement the missing methods in the `Settings` class. Here's an example of how you can implement these methods:

```python
class Settings:
    def __init__(self, master):
        self.master = master
        self.sound_volume = 50
        self.visual_theme = "Default"
        self.knight_appearance = "Default"
        self.chessboard_appearance = "Default"
        self.visited_square_appearance = "LightGray"

    def adjust_sound_volume(self, volume):
        self.sound_volume = volume

    def change_visual_theme(self, theme):
        self.visual_theme = theme

    def modify_knight_appearance(self, appearance):
        self.knight_appearance = appearance

    def modify_chessboard_appearance(self, appearance):
        self.chessboard_appearance = appearance

    def show_settings(self):
        messagebox.showinfo("Settings",
                            f"Sound Volume: {self.sound_volume}\nVisual Theme: {self.visual_theme}\nKnight Appearance: {self.knight_appearance}\nChessboard Appearance: {self.chessboard_appearance}")

    def customize_settings(self):
        options = ["Adjust Sound Volume", "Change Visual Theme", "Modify Knight Appearance", "Modify Chessboard Appearance"]
        choice = sd.askoption("Customize Settings", "Select an option", options=options, parent=self.master)
        if choice == "Adjust Sound Volume":
            volume = sd.askinteger("Adjust Sound Volume", "Enter sound volume (0-100)", minvalue=0, maxvalue=100, initialvalue=self.sound_volume, parent=self.master)
            self.adjust_sound_volume(volume)
        elif choice == "Change Visual Theme":
            theme = sd.askstring("Change Visual Theme", "Enter visual theme", initialvalue=self.visual_theme, parent=self.master)
            self.change_visual_theme(theme)
        elif choice == "Modify Knight Appearance":
            appearance = sd.askstring("Modify Knight Appearance", "Enter knight appearance", initialvalue=self.knight_appearance, parent=self.master)
            self.modify_knight_appearance(appearance)
        elif choice == "Modify Chessboard Appearance":
            appearance = sd.askstring("Modify Chessboard Appearance", "Enter chessboard appearance", initialvalue=self.chessboard_appearance, parent=self.master)
            self.modify_chessboard_appearance(appearance)
```

Once you have implemented these methods, the game settings functionality should work as expected."

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:
