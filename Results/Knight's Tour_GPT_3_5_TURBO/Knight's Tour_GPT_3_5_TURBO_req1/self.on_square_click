This code binds the `on_square_click` method to the left mouse button click event on the squares with the tag "square". You will need to implement the `on_square_click` method to call the `move_knight` method with the corresponding row and column of the clicked square.
Once you have made these changes, the player will be able to move the knight by clicking on the chessboard squares."
