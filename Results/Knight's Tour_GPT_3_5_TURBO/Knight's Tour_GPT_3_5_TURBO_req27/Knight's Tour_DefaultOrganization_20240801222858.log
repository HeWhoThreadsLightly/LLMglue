I think developing the puzzle game as a desktop application would be the most suitable modality. It would allow for a more interactive and immersive experience for the players. Additionally, it would provide more flexibility in terms of implementing the game mechanics and user interface.

I agree with your suggestion. Developing the puzzle game as a desktop application would indeed provide a more interactive and immersive experience for the players. It would also give us more control over the game mechanics and user interface. Therefore, I believe developing the puzzle game as a desktop application is the best modality for this project.

<COMMENT>
The code is missing the implementation of the `select_difficulty` method in the `Board` class. This method is called in the `start` method of the `Game` class, but it is not defined in the `Board` class. 

To fix this, you need to add the `select_difficulty` method to the `Board` class. This method should display a dialog box to the user, allowing them to select the difficulty level. The selected difficulty level should then be returned by the method.

Here is an example implementation of the `select_difficulty` method:

```python
def select_difficulty(self):
    difficulty = sd.askstring("Select Difficulty", "Choose difficulty level", initialvalue="Easy", parent=self.master)
    return difficulty
```

Please add this method to the `Board` class and update the code accordingly.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code is missing the implementation of the `select_difficulty` method in the `Board` class. This method is called in the `start` method of the `Game` class, but it is not defined in the `Board` class. 

To fix this, you need to add the `select_difficulty` method to the `Board` class. This method should display a dialog box to the user, allowing them to select the difficulty level. The selected difficulty level should then be returned by the method.

Here is an example implementation of the `select_difficulty` method:

```python
def select_difficulty(self):
    difficulty = sd.askstring("Select Difficulty", "Choose difficulty level", initialvalue="Easy", parent=self.master)
    return difficulty
```

Please add this method to the `Board` class and update the code accordingly."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

Here is a new customer's task: Develop a desktop puzzle game based on the mathematical problem known as the "Knight's Tour". In this game, the player controls a chess knight, and the objective is to move the knight across a chessboard (or any m x n grid) so that it visits every square exactly once. The challenge increases with the size of the board, and the game can offer various levels of difficulty. The knight moves in an L-shape, as it does in traditional chess
REQ1 User interface: Main menu: Start Game: Begins a new game. Players can select the difficulty level or board size here.
REQ2 User interface: Main menu: Options/Settings: Allows players to customize game settings, including sound volume, visual themes, and knight/chessboard appearances.
REQ3 User interface: Main menu: Tutorial: A brief interactive or video tutorial on how the game is played, detailing the knight's legal moves.

| **task_prompt** | Develop a desktop puzzle game based on the mathematical problem known as the "Knight's Tour". In this game, the player controls a chess knight, and the objective is to move the knight across a chessboard (or any m x n grid) so that it visits every square exactly once. The challenge increases with the size of the board, and the game can offer various levels of difficulty. The knight moves in an L-shape, as it does in traditional chess REQ1 User interface: Main menu: Start Game: Begins a new game. Players can select the difficulty level or board size here. REQ2 User interface: Main menu: Options/Settings: Allows players to customize game settings, including sound volume, visual themes, and knight/chessboard appearances. REQ3 User interface: Main menu: Tutorial: A brief interactive or video tutorial on how the game is played, detailing the knight's legal moves. REQ4 User interface: Main menu: High Scores: Displays a list of high scores, possibly with filters for different board sizes. REQ5 User interface: Main menu: Exit: Quits the game. REQ6 User interface: Game window: Chessboard/Grid Display: Centrally displays the game board with a clear distinction between visited and unvisited squares. The current position of the knight is highlighted. REQ7 User interface: Game window: Move Counter: Shows the number of moves made by the player. REQ8 User interface: Game window: Timer: (Optional) A timer showing how long the player has been attempting the current puzzle. REQ9 User interface: Game window: Undo Button: Allows the player to undo the last move. This could be limited to a certain number of uses. REQ10 User interface: Game window: Hint Button: Provides a hint for the next move. This could be limited to ensure the game remains challenging. REQ11 User interface: Game window: Pause/Menu Button: Pauses the game and opens a menu for accessing settings, returning to the main menu, or restarting the game. REQ12 User Interface: Options/Settings Window: Visual Settings: Options to change the theme of the chessboard and the knight. This could include color schemes or graphical styles. REQ13 User Interface: Options/Settings Window: Difficulty Settings: Allows users to choose the size of the chessboard, affecting the difficulty. The window might also offer toggles for advanced features like the timer. REQ14 User interface: High scores window: Score List: Displays a list of high scores, with details such as player name, score (based on moves and time), and board size. REQ15 User interface: High scores window: Filters: Allows users to filter scores by board size or difficulty level. REQ16 User interface: Tutorial window: Interactive Tutorial: A step-by-step guide that introduces the player to the game mechanics, including how the knight moves, the objective of the game, and any unique features (e.g., hints, undos). REQ17 User Interface: Pause Menu (In-Game): Resume Game: Returns to the game. REQ18 User Interface: Pause Menu (In-Game): Restart Game: Starts a new game with the same settings. REQ19 User Interface: Pause Menu (In-Game): Settings: Opens the Options/Settings window. REQ20 User Interface: Pause Menu (In-Game): Main Menu: Returns to the main menu (with a warning about losing current game progress). REQ21 Additional feature requirements: Game mechanics: Implement the knight's legal moves based on chess rules. REQ22 Additional feature requirements: Game mechanics: Prevent the knight from visiting a square more than once. REQ23 Additional feature requirements: Game mechanics: Detect when the player has successfully completed the tour or if the tour is no longer possible to complete. REQ24 Additional feature requirements: Levels and challenges: Offer boards of different sizes (e.g., 8x8, 6x6, 10x10) to cater to various levels of difficulty. REQ25 Additional feature requirements: Levels and challenges: Include a timer and move counter to challenge players to complete the puzzle faster or in fewer moves. REQ26 Additional feature requirements: Scoring and progression: Implement a scoring system based on the time taken to complete the tour, and the difficulty level of the board. REQ27 Additional feature requirements: Scoring and progression: Save high scores and player progress. |

<COMMENT>
The code provided is missing the implementation of the `select_difficulty` method in the `Board` class. This method is called in the `start` method of the `Game` class, but it is not defined in the `Board` class. 

To fix this issue, you need to add the `select_difficulty` method to the `Board` class. Here's an example implementation:

```python
def select_difficulty(self):
    difficulty = sd.askstring("Select Difficulty", "Choose difficulty level", initialvalue="Easy", parent=self.master)
    return difficulty
```

This method should prompt the user to select a difficulty level and return the chosen difficulty.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code provided is missing the implementation of the `select_difficulty` method in the `Board` class. This method is called in the `start` method of the `Game` class, but it is not defined in the `Board` class. 

To fix this issue, you need to add the `select_difficulty` method to the `Board` class. Here's an example implementation:

```python
def select_difficulty(self):
    difficulty = sd.askstring("Select Difficulty", "Choose difficulty level", initialvalue="Easy", parent=self.master)
    return difficulty
```

This method should prompt the user to select a difficulty level and return the chosen difficulty."

| **task_prompt** | Develop a desktop puzzle game based on the mathematical problem known as the "Knight's Tour". In this game, the player controls a chess knight, and the objective is to move the knight across a chessboard (or any m x n grid) so that it visits every square exactly once. The challenge increases with the size of the board, and the game can offer various levels of difficulty. The knight moves in an L-shape, as it does in traditional chess REQ1 User interface: Main menu: Start Game: Begins a new game. Players can select the difficulty level or board size here. REQ2 User interface: Main menu: Options/Settings: Allows players to customize game settings, including sound volume, visual themes, and knight/chessboard appearances. REQ3 User interface: Main menu: Tutorial: A brief interactive or video tutorial on how the game is played, detailing the knight's legal moves. REQ4 User interface: Main menu: High Scores: Displays a list of high scores, possibly with filters for different board sizes. REQ5 User interface: Main menu: Exit: Quits the game. REQ6 User interface: Game window: Chessboard/Grid Display: Centrally displays the game board with a clear distinction between visited and unvisited squares. The current position of the knight is highlighted. REQ7 User interface: Game window: Move Counter: Shows the number of moves made by the player. REQ8 User interface: Game window: Timer: (Optional) A timer showing how long the player has been attempting the current puzzle. REQ9 User interface: Game window: Undo Button: Allows the player to undo the last move. This could be limited to a certain number of uses. REQ10 User interface: Game window: Hint Button: Provides a hint for the next move. This could be limited to ensure the game remains challenging. REQ11 User interface: Game window: Pause/Menu Button: Pauses the game and opens a menu for accessing settings, returning to the main menu, or restarting the game. REQ12 User Interface: Options/Settings Window: Visual Settings: Options to change the theme of the chessboard and the knight. This could include color schemes or graphical styles. REQ13 User Interface: Options/Settings Window: Difficulty Settings: Allows users to choose the size of the chessboard, affecting the difficulty. The window might also offer toggles for advanced features like the timer. REQ14 User interface: High scores window: Score List: Displays a list of high scores, with details such as player name, score (based on moves and time), and board size. REQ15 User interface: High scores window: Filters: Allows users to filter scores by board size or difficulty level. REQ16 User interface: Tutorial window: Interactive Tutorial: A step-by-step guide that introduces the player to the game mechanics, including how the knight moves, the objective of the game, and any unique features (e.g., hints, undos). REQ17 User Interface: Pause Menu (In-Game): Resume Game: Returns to the game. REQ18 User Interface: Pause Menu (In-Game): Restart Game: Starts a new game with the same settings. REQ19 User Interface: Pause Menu (In-Game): Settings: Opens the Options/Settings window. REQ20 User Interface: Pause Menu (In-Game): Main Menu: Returns to the main menu (with a warning about losing current game progress). REQ21 Additional feature requirements: Game mechanics: Implement the knight's legal moves based on chess rules. REQ22 Additional feature requirements: Game mechanics: Prevent the knight from visiting a square more than once. REQ23 Additional feature requirements: Game mechanics: Detect when the player has successfully completed the tour or if the tour is no longer possible to complete. REQ24 Additional feature requirements: Levels and challenges: Offer boards of different sizes (e.g., 8x8, 6x6, 10x10) to cater to various levels of difficulty. REQ25 Additional feature requirements: Levels and challenges: Include a timer and move counter to challenge players to complete the puzzle faster or in fewer moves. REQ26 Additional feature requirements: Scoring and progression: Implement a scoring system based on the time taken to complete the tour, and the difficulty level of the board. REQ27 Additional feature requirements: Scoring and progression: Save high scores and player progress. |

<COMMENT>
The code is missing the implementation of the `select_difficulty` method in the `Board` class. This method is called in the `start` method of the `Game` class, but it is not defined in the `Board` class. To fix this, you need to add the `select_difficulty` method to the `Board` class.

Here is the revised code for the `Board` class:

```python

                fill_color = self.settings.chessboard_appearance
                if (row, col) in self.visited_squares:
                    fill_color = self.settings.visited_square_appearance
                self.canvas.create_rectangle(x1, y1, x2, y2, fill=fill_color)

 <COMMENT>
The code is missing the implementation of the `select_difficulty` method in the `Board` class. This method is called in the `start` method of the `Game` class, but it is not defined in the `Board` class. To fix this, you need to add the `select_difficulty` method to the `Board` class.

Here is the revised code for the `Board` class:

```python
class Board:
    def __init__(self, master, difficulty, settings):
        self.master = master
        self.difficulty = difficulty
        self.size = self.get_board_size()
        self.canvas = tk.Canvas(self.master, width=400, height=400)
        self.canvas.pack()
        self.square_size = 400 // self.size
        self.settings = settings
        self.visited_squares = set()

    def get_board_size(self):
        if self.difficulty == "Easy":
            return 5
        elif self.difficulty == "Medium":
            return 6
        elif self.difficulty == "Hard":
            return 8

    def draw(self):
        self.canvas.delete("all")
        for row in range(self.size):
            for col in range(self.size):
                x1, y1, x2, y2 = self.get_square_coordinates(row, col)
                fill_color = self.settings.chessboard_appearance
                if (row, col) in self.visited_squares:
                    fill_color = self.settings.visited_square_appearance
                self.canvas.create_rectangle(x1, y1, x2, y2, fill=fill_color)

    def get_square_coordinates(self, row, col):
        x1 = col * self.square_size
        y1 = row * self.square_size
        x2 = x1 + self.square_size
        y2 = y1 + self.square_size
        return x1, y1, x2, y2

    def select_difficulty(self):
        difficulty = sd.askstring("Select Difficulty", "Choose difficulty level", initialvalue="Easy", parent=self.master)
        return difficulty

    def is_valid_move(self, row, col):
        if row < 0 or row >= self.size or col < 0 or col >= self.size:
            return False
        return True

    def is_visited(self, row, col):
        return (row, col) in self.visited_squares

    def mark_visited(self, row, col):
        self.visited_squares.add((row, col))

    def unmark_visited(self, row, col):
        self.visited_squares.remove((row, col))
```

Please add the `select_difficulty` method to the `Board` class as shown above.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code is missing the implementation of the `select_difficulty` method in the `Board` class. This method is called in the `start` method of the `Game` class, but it is not defined in the `Board` class. To fix this, you need to add the `select_difficulty` method to the `Board` class.

Here is the revised code for the `Board` class:

```python
class Board:
    def __init__(self, master, difficulty, settings):
        self.master = master
        self.difficulty = difficulty
        self.size = self.get_board_size()
        self.canvas = tk.Canvas(self.master, width=400, height=400)
        self.canvas.pack()
        self.square_size = 400 // self.size
        self.settings = settings
        self.visited_squares = set()

    def get_board_size(self):
        if self.difficulty == "Easy":
            return 5
        elif self.difficulty == "Medium":
            return 6
        elif self.difficulty == "Hard":
            return 8

    def draw(self):
        self.canvas.delete("all")
        for row in range(self.size):
            for col in range(self.size):
                x1, y1, x2, y2 = self.get_square_coordinates(row, col)
                fill_color = self.settings.chessboard_appearance
                if (row, col) in self.visited_squares:
                    fill_color = self.settings.visited_square_appearance
                self.canvas.create_rectangle(x1, y1, x2, y2, fill=fill_color)

    def get_square_coordinates(self, row, col):
        x1 = col * self.square_size
        y1 = row * self.square_size
        x2 = x1 + self.square_size
        y2 = y1 + self.square_size
        return x1, y1, x2, y2

    def select_difficulty(self):
        difficulty = sd.askstring("Select Difficulty", "Choose difficulty level", initialvalue="Easy", parent=self.master)
        return difficulty

    def is_valid_move(self, row, col):
        if row < 0 or row >= self.size or col < 0 or col >= self.size:
            return False
        return True

    def is_visited(self, row, col):
        return (row, col) in self.visited_squares

    def mark_visited(self, row, col):
        self.visited_squares.add((row, col))

    def unmark_visited(self, row, col):
        self.visited_squares.remove((row, col))
```

Please add the `select_difficulty` method to the `Board` class as shown above."

Here is a new customer's task: Develop a desktop puzzle game based on the mathematical problem known as the "Knight's Tour". In this game, the player controls a chess knight, and the objective is to move the knight across a chessboard (or any m x n grid) so that it visits every square exactly once. The challenge increases with the size of the board, and the game can offer various levels of difficulty. The knight moves in an L-shape, as it does in traditional chess
REQ1 User interface: Main menu: Start Game: Begins a new game. Players can select the difficulty level or board size here.
REQ2 User interface: Main menu: Options/Settings: Allows players to customize game settings, including sound volume, visual themes, and knight/chessboard appearances.
REQ3 User interface: Main menu: Tutorial: A brief interactive or video tutorial on how the game is played, detailing the knight's legal moves.
REQ4 User interface: Main menu: High Scores: Displays a list of high scores, possibly with filters for different board sizes.
REQ5 User interface: Main menu: Exit: Quits the game.
REQ6 User interface: Game window: Chessboard/Grid Display: Centrally displays the game board with a clear distinction between visited and unvisited squares. The current position of the knight is highlighted.
REQ7 User interface: Game window: Move Counter: Shows the number of moves made by the player.
REQ8 User interface: Game window: Timer: (Optional) A timer showing how long the player has been attempting the current puzzle.
REQ9 User interface: Game window: Undo Button: Allows the player to undo the last move. This could be limited to a certain number of uses.

REQ25 Additional feature requirements: Levels and challenges: Include a timer and move counter to challenge players to complete the puzzle faster or in fewer moves.
REQ26 Additional feature requirements: Scoring and progression: Implement a scoring system based on the time taken to complete the tour, and the difficulty level of the board.
REQ27 Additional feature requirements: Scoring and progression: Save high scores and player progress..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:
