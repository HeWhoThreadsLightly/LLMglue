<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `select_difficulty` method in the `Board` class is not implemented. This method is required for the user interface to select the difficulty level. To fix this, you need to implement the method and return the selected difficulty level.

Here's an example implementation for the `select_difficulty` method in the `Board` class:

```python
def select_difficulty(self):
    # Create a dialog box to select the difficulty level
    difficulty_dialog = tk.Toplevel(self.master)
    difficulty_dialog.title("Select Difficulty")
    
    # Create a label and dropdown menu for selecting the difficulty level
    label = tk.Label(difficulty_dialog, text="Select Difficulty:")
    label.pack()
    
    difficulty_var = tk.StringVar(difficulty_dialog)
    difficulty_var.set("Easy")  # Set the default difficulty level
    
    dropdown = tk.OptionMenu(difficulty_dialog, difficulty_var, "Easy", "Medium", "Hard")
    dropdown.pack()
    
    # Create a button to confirm the selection
    confirm_button = tk.Button(difficulty_dialog, text="Confirm", command=difficulty_dialog.destroy)
    confirm_button.pack()
    
    # Wait for the difficulty dialog to be closed
    self.master.wait_window(difficulty_dialog)
    
    # Return the selected difficulty level
    return difficulty_var.get()
```

This implementation creates a new dialog box with a label, dropdown menu, and confirm button. The selected difficulty level is returned when the confirm button is clicked.

After implementing the `select_difficulty` method, the user interface for selecting the difficulty level will be functional.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `select_difficulty` method in the `Board` class is not implemented. This method is required for the user interface to select the difficulty level. To fix this, you need to implement the method and return the selected difficulty level.

Here's an example implementation for the `select_difficulty` method in the `Board` class:

```python
def select_difficulty(self):
    # Create a dialog box to select the difficulty level
    difficulty_dialog = tk.Toplevel(self.master)
    difficulty_dialog.title("Select Difficulty")
    
    # Create a label and dropdown menu for selecting the difficulty level
    label = tk.Label(difficulty_dialog, text="Select Difficulty:")
    label.pack()
    
    difficulty_var = tk.StringVar(difficulty_dialog)
    difficulty_var.set("Easy")  # Set the default difficulty level
    
    dropdown = tk.OptionMenu(difficulty_dialog, difficulty_var, "Easy", "Medium", "Hard")
    dropdown.pack()
    
    # Create a button to confirm the selection
    confirm_button = tk.Button(difficulty_dialog, text="Confirm", command=difficulty_dialog.destroy)
    confirm_button.pack()
    
    # Wait for the difficulty dialog to be closed
    self.master.wait_window(difficulty_dialog)
    
    # Return the selected difficulty level
    return difficulty_var.get()
```

This implementation creates a new dialog box with a label, dropdown menu, and confirm button. The selected difficulty level is returned when the confirm button is clicked.

After implementing the `select_difficulty` method, the user interface for selecting the difficulty level will be functional."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

        self.board = board
        self.current_row = 0
        self.current_col = 0

        self.board.canvas.create_oval(x1, y1, x2, y2, fill="blue")
```

Now, all the codes have been modified based on the comments. The `select_difficulty` method has been implemented in the `Board` class to allow the user to select the difficulty level. The game should now function as expected.

<COMMENT>
In the `board.py` module, the `select_difficulty` method is missing the implementation for creating a dialog box to select the difficulty level. Currently, it only returns the default difficulty level "Easy". To fix this, you need to implement the dialog box creation and return the selected difficulty level.

<REVISION>
To implement the `select_difficulty` method in the `board.py` module, you can use the `simpledialog` module from the `tkinter` library to create a dialog box. Here's an example of how you can modify the method:

```python
import tkinter.simpledialog as sd

# ...

def select_difficulty(self):
    difficulty = sd.askstring("Select Difficulty", "Choose difficulty level", initialvalue="Easy", parent=self.master)
    return difficulty
```

This will create a dialog box with an input field where the user can enter the difficulty level. The initial value is set to "Easy" as the default. The selected difficulty level will be returned by the `askstring` method.

Once you've made the above changes, the `select_difficulty` method will prompt the user to select a difficulty level and return the selected value.

Please make the necessary changes and ensure that the `select_difficulty` method is implemented correctly.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
In the `board.py` module, the `select_difficulty` method is missing the implementation for creating a dialog box to select the difficulty level. Currently, it only returns the default difficulty level "Easy". To fix this, you need to implement the dialog box creation and return the selected difficulty level.

<REVISION>
To implement the `select_difficulty` method in the `board.py` module, you can use the `simpledialog` module from the `tkinter` library to create a dialog box. Here's an example of how you can modify the method:

```python
import tkinter.simpledialog as sd

# ...

def select_difficulty(self):
    difficulty = sd.askstring("Select Difficulty", "Choose difficulty level", initialvalue="Easy", parent=self.master)
    return difficulty
```

This will create a dialog box with an input field where the user can enter the difficulty level. The initial value is set to "Easy" as the default. The selected difficulty level will be returned by the `askstring` method.

Once you've made the above changes, the `select_difficulty` method will prompt the user to select a difficulty level and return the selected value.

Please make the necessary changes and ensure that the `select_difficulty` method is implemented correctly."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the `move_knight` method in the `Knight` class. This method is responsible for moving the knight to a new position on the board. 

To fix this, you need to add the `move_knight` method to the `Knight` class in the `knight.py` file. Here's an example implementation:

```python
class Knight:
    def __init__(self, board):
        self.board = board
        self.current_row = 0
        self.current_col = 0

    def draw(self):
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = self.board.get_square_coordinates(self.current_row, self.current_col)
        self.board.canvas.create_oval(x1, y1, x2, y2, fill="blue")

    def move_knight(self, row, col):
        self.current_row = row
        self.current_col = col
        self.draw()
```

Once you've added the `move_knight` method, the knight will be able to move to a new position on the board when the `move_knight` method is called.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the `move_knight` method in the `Knight` class. This method is responsible for moving the knight to a new position on the board. 

To fix this, you need to add the `move_knight` method to the `Knight` class in the `knight.py` file. Here's an example implementation:

```python
class Knight:
    def __init__(self, board):
        self.board = board
        self.current_row = 0
        self.current_col = 0

    def draw(self):
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = self.board.get_square_coordinates(self.current_row, self.current_col)
        self.board.canvas.create_oval(x1, y1, x2, y2, fill="blue")

    def move_knight(self, row, col):
        self.current_row = row
        self.current_col = col
        self.draw()
```

Once you've added the `move_knight` method, the knight will be able to move to a new position on the board when the `move_knight` method is called."

# Knight's Tour Puzzle Game User Manual

## Introduction

Welcome to the Knight's Tour Puzzle Game! This desktop application is based on the mathematical problem known as the "Knight's Tour". In this game, your objective is to move a chess knight across a chessboard (or any m x n grid) so that it visits every square exactly once. The challenge increases with the size of the board, and the game offers various levels of difficulty.

## Installation

To install and run the Knight's Tour Puzzle Game, please follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Download the game code from the provided source code files.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the game code.

4. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This will install the necessary dependencies, including the `tkinter` library.

5. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the game by running the following command:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

   This will launch the game application.

## Main Menu

When you launch the game, you will see the main menu screen. The main menu provides the following options:

- **Start Game**: Begins a new game. You can select the difficulty level or board size here.

- **Options/Settings**: Allows you to customize game settings, including sound volume, visual themes, and knight/chessboard appearances.

- **Tutorial**: Provides a brief interactive or video tutorial on how the game is played, detailing the knight's legal moves.

## Gameplay

Once you start a new game, you will see the chessboard with the knight positioned at the starting square. Your goal is to move the knight across the chessboard, visiting every square exactly once.

To move the knight, simply click on a valid destination square. The knight will move in an L-shape, as it does in traditional chess. The game will update the knight's position and redraw the chessboard after each move.

The difficulty level or board size you selected in the main menu will determine the complexity of the puzzle. Larger boards or higher difficulty levels will present a greater challenge.

## Options/Settings

In the options/settings menu, you can customize various aspects of the game:

- **Sound Volume**: Adjust the volume of the game's sound effects.

- **Visual Themes**: Choose from different visual themes to change the appearance of the chessboard and knight.
