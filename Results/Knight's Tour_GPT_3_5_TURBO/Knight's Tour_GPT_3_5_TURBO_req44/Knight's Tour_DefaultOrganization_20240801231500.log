As the Chief Product Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and the product should be realizable, you should keep discussing with me to decide which product modality do we want the product to be?

Note that we must ONLY discuss the product modality and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion by replying with only one line, which starts with a single word <INFO>, followed by our final product modality without any other words, e.g., "<INFO> PowerPoint".

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the implementation of the "Hint" feature in the game. Currently, the "Hint" button calls the `show_hint()` method in the `GameWindow` class, which in turn calls the `get_hint()` method in the `Game` class. However, the `get_hint()` method in the `Game` class is not implemented.

To fix this, you need to implement the `get_hint()` method in the `Game` class. This method should calculate the next best move for the knight and return the coordinates of the suggested move. Once you have the coordinates, you can update the game state, mark the square as visited, and display a message to the player with the suggested move.

Here's an example of how the `get_hint()` method could be implemented:

```python
def get_hint(self):
    if self.is_paused or self.is_completed:
        return None

    # Get the current position of the knight
    current_row, current_col = self.knight.current_row, self.knight.current_col

    # Get the list of unvisited squares on the board
    unvisited_squares = []
    for row in range(self.board.size):
        for col in range(self.board.size):
            if not self.board.is_visited(row, col):
                unvisited_squares.append((row, col))

    # Calculate the distances from the current position to each unvisited square
    distances = []
    for square in unvisited_squares:
        row, col = square
        distance = abs(row - current_row) + abs(col - current_col)
        distances.append(distance)

    # Find the square with the minimum distance
    min_distance = min(distances)
    min_distance_index = distances.index(min_distance)
    hint_square = unvisited_squares[min_distance_index]

    # Update the game state
    self.move_history.append(hint_square)
    self.board.mark_visited(hint_square[0], hint_square[1])

    # Display a message to the player
    messagebox.showinfo("Hint", f"The next move is to square {hint_square[0] + 1}, {hint_square[1] + 1}.")

    # Return the hint square
    return hint_square
```

Once you have implemented the `get_hint()` method, the "Hint" feature should work as expected in the game.

    # Display a message to the player
    messagebox.showinfo("Hint", f"The next move is to square {hint_square[0] + 1}, {hint_square[1] + 1}.")

    # Return the hint square
    return hint_square

Currently, the "Hint" button calls the show_hint() method in the GameWindow class, which in turn calls the get_hint() method in the Game class. However, the get_hint() method in the Game class is not implemented.\n\nTo fix this, you need to implement the get_hint() method in the Game class. This method should calculate the next best move for the knight and return the coordinates of the suggested move. Once you have the coordinates, you can update the game state, mark the square as visited, and display a message to the player with the suggested move.\n\nHere\'s an example of how the get_hint() method could be implemented:\n\npython\ndef get_hint(self):\n    if self.is_paused or self.is_completed:\n        return None\n\n    # Get the current position of the knight\n    current_row, current_col = self.knight.current_row, self.knight.current_col\n\n    # Get the list of unvisited squares on the board\n    unvisited_squares = []\n    for row in range(self.board.size):\n        for col in range(self.board.size):\n            if not self.board.is_visited(row, col):\n                unvisited_squares.append((row, col))\n\n    # Calculate the distances from the current position to each unvisited square\n    distances = []\n    for square in unvisited_squares:\n        row, col = square\n        distance = abs(row - current_row) + abs(col - current_col)\n        distances.append(distance)\n\n    # Find the square with the minimum distance\n    min_distance = min(distances)\n    min_distance_index = distances.index(min_distance)\n    hint_square = unvisited_squares[min_distance_index]\n\n    # Update the game state\n    self.move_history.append(hint_square)\n    self.board.mark_visited(hint_square[0], hint_square[1])\n\n    # Display a message to the player\n    messagebox.showinfo("Hint", f"The next move is to square {hint_square[0] + 1}, {hint_square[1] + 1}.")\n\n    # Return the hint square\n    return hint_square\n\n\nOnce you have implemented the get_hint() method, the "Hint" feature should work as expected in the game.'} |

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the implementation of the "Hint" feature in the game. Currently, the "Hint" button calls the `show_hint()` method in the `GameWindow` class, which in turn calls the `get_hint()` method in the `Game` class. However, the `get_hint()` method in the `Game` class is not implemented.

To fix this, you need to implement the `get_hint()` method in the `Game` class. This method should calculate the next best move for the knight and return the coordinates of the suggested move. Once you have the coordinates, you can update the game state, mark the square as visited, and display a message to the player with the suggested move.

Here's an example of how the `get_hint()` method could be implemented:

```python
def get_hint(self):
    if self.is_paused or self.is_completed:
        return None

    # Get the current position of the knight
    current_row, current_col = self.knight.current_row, self.knight.current_col

    # Get the list of unvisited squares on the board
    unvisited_squares = []
    for row in range(self.board.size):
        for col in range(self.board.size):
            if not self.board.is_visited(row, col):
                unvisited_squares.append((row, col))

    # Calculate the distances from the current position to each unvisited square
    distances = []
    for square in unvisited_squares:
        row, col = square
        distance = abs(row - current_row) + abs(col - current_col)
        distances.append(distance)

    # Find the square with the minimum distance
    min_distance = min(distances)
    min_distance_index = distances.index(min_distance)
    hint_square = unvisited_squares[min_distance_index]

    # Update the game state
    self.move_history.append(hint_square)
    self.board.mark_visited(hint_square[0], hint_square[1])

    # Display a message to the player
    messagebox.showinfo("Hint", f"The next move is to square {hint_square[0] + 1}, {hint_square[1] + 1}.")

    # Return the hint square
    return hint_square
```

Once you have implemented the `get_hint()` method, the "Hint" feature should work as expected in the game."

Currently, the "Hint" button calls the show_hint() method in the GameWindow class, which in turn calls the get_hint() method in the Game class. However, the get_hint() method in the Game class is not implemented.\n\nTo fix this, you need to implement the get_hint() method in the Game class. This method should calculate the next best move for the knight and return the coordinates of the suggested move. Once you have the coordinates, you can update the game state, mark the square as visited, and display a message to the player with the suggested move.\n\nHere\'s an example of how the get_hint() method could be implemented:\n\npython\ndef get_hint(self):\n    if self.is_paused or self.is_completed:\n        return None\n\n    # Get the current position of the knight\n    current_row, current_col = self.knight.current_row, self.knight.current_col\n\n    # Get the list of unvisited squares on the board\n    unvisited_squares = []\n    for row in range(self.board.size):\n        for col in range(self.board.size):\n            if not self.board.is_visited(row, col):\n                unvisited_squares.append((row, col))\n\n    # Calculate the distances from the current position to each unvisited square\n    distances = []\n    for square in unvisited_squares:\n        row, col = square\n        distance = abs(row - current_row) + abs(col - current_col)\n        distances.append(distance)\n\n    # Find the square with the minimum distance\n    min_distance = min(distances)\n    min_distance_index = distances.index(min_distance)\n    hint_square = unvisited_squares[min_distance_index]\n\n    # Update the game state\n    self.move_history.append(hint_square)\n    self.board.mark_visited(hint_square[0], hint_square[1])\n\n    # Display a message to the player\n    messagebox.showinfo("Hint", f"The next move is to square {hint_square[0] + 1}, {hint_square[1] + 1}.")\n\n    # Return the hint square\n    return hint_square\n\n\nOnce you have implemented the get_hint() method, the "Hint" feature should work as expected in the game.'} |

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the implementation of the "Hint" feature in the game. Currently, the "Hint" button calls the `show_hint` method in the `GameWindow` class, which then calls the `get_hint` method in the `Game` class. However, the `get_hint` method in the `Game` class does not return the hint square to the `GameWindow` class, resulting in the hint not being displayed to the player.

To fix this, we need to modify the `get_hint` method in the `Game` class to return the hint square. Then, in the `show_hint` method in the `GameWindow` class, we can display the hint to the player.

Here's the revised code for the `Game` class:

```python
class Game:
    # ...

    def get_hint(self):
        if self.is_paused or self.is_completed:
            return None
        # Get the current position of the knight
        current_row, current_col = self.knight.current_row, self.knight.current_col
        # Get the list of unvisited squares on the board
        unvisited_squares = []
        for row in range(self.board.size):
            for col in range(self.board.size):
                if not self.board.is_visited(row, col):
                    unvisited_squares.append((row, col))
        # Calculate the distances from the current position to each unvisited square
        distances = []
        for square in unvisited_squares:
            row, col = square
            distance = abs(row - current_row) + abs(col - current_col)
            distances.append(distance)
        # Find the square with the minimum distance
        min_distance = min(distances)
        min_distance_index = distances.index(min_distance)
        hint_square = unvisited_squares[min_distance_index]
        # Update the game state
        self.move_history.append(hint_square)
        self.board.mark_visited(hint_square[0], hint_square[1])
        # Return the hint square
        return hint_square

    # ...
```

And here's the revised code for the `GameWindow` class:

```python
class GameWindow:
    # ...

    def show_hint(self):
        if self.is_paused or self.is_completed:
            return
        hint_square = self.game.get_hint()
        if hint_square:
            messagebox.showinfo("Hint", f"The next move is to square {hint_square[0] + 1}, {hint_square[1] + 1}.")
        else:
            messagebox.showinfo("Hint", "No more hints available.")

    # ...
}
```

With these changes, the hint will be displayed to the player when they click the "Hint" button.

        distances = []
        for square in unvisited_squares:
            row, col = square
            distance = abs(row - current_row) + abs(col - current_col)

        # Find the square with the minimum distance
        min_distance = min(distances)
        min_distance_index = distances.index(min_distance)
        hint_square = unvisited_squares[min_distance_index]
        # Update the game state
        self.move_history.append(hint_square)
        self.board.mark_visited(hint_square[0], hint_square[1])
        # Return the hint square
        return hint_square

    # ...
```

And here's the revised code for the `GameWindow` class:

```python
class GameWindow:
    # ...

    def show_hint(self):
        if self.is_paused or self.is_completed:
            return
        hint_square = self.game.get_hint()
        if hint_square:
            messagebox.showinfo("Hint", f"The next move is to square {hint_square[0] + 1}, {hint_square[1] + 1}.")
        else:
            messagebox.showinfo("Hint", "No more hints available.")

    # ...
}
```

With these changes, the hint will be displayed to the player when they click the "Hint" button.

However, the get_hint method in the Game class does not return the hint square to the GameWindow class, resulting in the hint not being displayed to the player.\n\nTo fix this, we need to modify the get_hint method in the Game class to return the hint square.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the implementation of the "Hint" feature in the game. Currently, the "Hint" button calls the `show_hint` method in the `GameWindow` class, which then calls the `get_hint` method in the `Game` class. However, the `get_hint` method in the `Game` class does not return the hint square to the `GameWindow` class, resulting in the hint not being displayed to the player.

To fix this, we need to modify the `get_hint` method in the `Game` class to return the hint square. Then, in the `show_hint` method in the `GameWindow` class, we can display the hint to the player.

Here's the revised code for the `Game` class:

```python
class Game:
    # ...

    def get_hint(self):
        if self.is_paused or self.is_completed:
            return None
        # Get the current position of the knight
        current_row, current_col = self.knight.current_row, self.knight.current_col
        # Get the list of unvisited squares on the board
        unvisited_squares = []
        for row in range(self.board.size):
            for col in range(self.board.size):
                if not self.board.is_visited(row, col):
                    unvisited_squares.append((row, col))
        # Calculate the distances from the current position to each unvisited square
        distances = []
        for square in unvisited_squares:
            row, col = square
            distance = abs(row - current_row) + abs(col - current_col)
            distances.append(distance)
        # Find the square with the minimum distance
        min_distance = min(distances)
        min_distance_index = distances.index(min_distance)
        hint_square = unvisited_squares[min_distance_index]
        # Update the game state
        self.move_history.append(hint_square)
        self.board.mark_visited(hint_square[0], hint_square[1])
        # Return the hint square
        return hint_square

    # ...
```

And here's the revised code for the `GameWindow` class:

```python
class GameWindow:
    # ...

    def show_hint(self):
        if self.is_paused or self.is_completed:
            return
        hint_square = self.game.get_hint()
        if hint_square:
            messagebox.showinfo("Hint", f"The next move is to square {hint_square[0] + 1}, {hint_square[1] + 1}.")
        else:
            messagebox.showinfo("Hint", "No more hints available.")

    # ...
}
```

With these changes, the hint will be displayed to the player when they click the "Hint" button.

However, the get_hint method in the Game class does not return the hint square to the GameWindow class, resulting in the hint not being displayed to the player.\n\nTo fix this, we need to modify the get_hint method in the Game class to return the hint square.

<COMMENT>
In the `GameWindow` class, the `handle_board_click` method is missing a check to prevent the player from making a move after the game has been completed. This check should be added to ensure that the player cannot continue making moves after completing the puzzle.

To fix this, add the following check at the beginning of the `handle_board_click` method:

```python
if self.is_completed:
    return
```

This will prevent any further moves from being made once the game has been completed.

After making this change, the code should be reviewed again to ensure that all the regulations and requirements are met.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
In the `GameWindow` class, the `handle_board_click` method is missing a check to prevent the player from making a move after the game has been completed. This check should be added to ensure that the player cannot continue making moves after completing the puzzle.

To fix this, add the following check at the beginning of the `handle_board_click` method:

```python
if self.is_completed:
    return
```

This will prevent any further moves from being made once the game has been completed.

After making this change, the code should be reviewed again to ensure that all the regulations and requirements are met."

| **task_prompt** | Develop a desktop puzzle game based on the mathematical problem known as the "Knight's Tour". In this game, the player controls a chess knight, and the objective is to move the knight across a chessboard (or any m x n grid) so that it visits every square exactly once. The challenge increases with the size of the board, and the game can offer various levels of difficulty. The knight moves in an L-shape, as it does in traditional chess REQ1 User interface: Main menu: Start Game: Begins a new game. Players can select the difficulty level or board size here. REQ2 User interface: Main menu: Options/Settings: Allows players to customize game settings, including sound volume, visual themes, and knight/chessboard appearances. REQ3 User interface: Main menu: Tutorial: A brief interactive or video tutorial on how the game is played, detailing the knight's legal moves. REQ4 User interface: Main menu: High Scores: Displays a list of high scores, possibly with filters for different board sizes. REQ5 User interface: Main menu: Exit: Quits the game. REQ6 User interface: Game window: Chessboard/Grid Display: Centrally displays the game board with a clear distinction between visited and unvisited squares. The current position of the knight is highlighted. REQ7 User interface: Game window: Move Counter: Shows the number of moves made by the player. REQ8 User interface: Game window: Timer: (Optional) A timer showing how long the player has been attempting the current puzzle. REQ9 User interface: Game window: Undo Button: Allows the player to undo the last move. This could be limited to a certain number of uses. REQ10 User interface: Game window: Hint Button: Provides a hint for the next move. This could be limited to ensure the game remains challenging. REQ11 User interface: Game window: Pause/Menu Button: Pauses the game and opens a menu for accessing settings, returning to the main menu, or restarting the game. REQ12 User Interface: Options/Settings Window: Visual Settings: Options to change the theme of the chessboard and the knight. This could include color schemes or graphical styles. REQ13 User Interface: Options/Settings Window: Difficulty Settings: Allows users to choose the size of the chessboard, affecting the difficulty. The window might also offer toggles for advanced features like the timer. REQ14 User interface: High scores window: Score List: Displays a list of high scores, with details such as player name, score (based on moves and time), and board size. REQ15 User interface: High scores window: Filters: Allows users to filter scores by board size or difficulty level. REQ16 User interface: Tutorial window: Interactive Tutorial: A step-by-step guide that introduces the player to the game mechanics, including how the knight moves, the objective of the game, and any unique features (e.g., hints, undos). REQ17 User Interface: Pause Menu (In-Game): Resume Game: Returns to the game. REQ18 User Interface: Pause Menu (In-Game): Restart Game: Starts a new game with the same settings. REQ19 User Interface: Pause Menu (In-Game): Settings: Opens the Options/Settings window.

REQ22 Additional feature requirements: Game mechanics: Prevent the knight from visiting a square more than once. REQ23 Additional feature requirements: Game mechanics: Detect when the player has successfully completed the tour or if the tour is no longer possible to complete. REQ24 Additional feature requirements: Levels and challenges: Offer boards of different sizes (e.g., 8x8, 6x6, 10x10) to cater to various levels of difficulty. REQ25 Additional feature requirements: Levels and challenges: Include a timer and move counter to challenge players to complete the puzzle faster or in fewer moves. REQ26 Additional feature requirements: Scoring and progression: Implement a scoring system based on the time taken to complete the tour, and the difficulty level of the board. REQ27 Additional feature requirements: Scoring and progression: Save high scores and player progress. REQ28 Additional feature requirements: Tutorials and hints: Provide a brief interactive tutorial on how to play the game and move the knight. REQ29 Additional feature requirements: Tutorials and hints: Offer hints or allow users to undo moves to help beginners. REQ30 Additional feature requirements: Customization and preferences: Allow players to customize the appearance of the chessboard and the knight.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:
