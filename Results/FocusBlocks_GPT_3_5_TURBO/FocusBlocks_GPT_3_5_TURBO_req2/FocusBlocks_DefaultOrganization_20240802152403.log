As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the start() method in the PomodoroTimer class is missing the logic to handle breaks and longer breaks after every four focus sessions. Currently, it only handles the work duration. To fix this, we need to add the logic for breaks and longer breaks in the start() method.

Here's the revised code for the start() method in the PomodoroTimer class:

```python
def start(self):
    self.is_running = True
    focus_sessions = 0
    while self.remaining_time > 0:
        self.remaining_time -= 1
        time.sleep(1)
        if self.remaining_time == 0:
            if focus_sessions < 3:
                self.remaining_time = self.short_break_duration
                focus_sessions += 1
            else:
                self.remaining_time = self.long_break_duration
                focus_sessions = 0
    self.is_running = False
```

This updated code will handle the breaks and longer breaks according to the requirements.

Please make the necessary changes and ensure that the code meets all the regulations mentioned.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the start() method in the PomodoroTimer class is missing the logic to handle breaks and longer breaks after every four focus sessions. Currently, it only handles the work duration. To fix this, we need to add the logic for breaks and longer breaks in the start() method.

Here's the revised code for the start() method in the PomodoroTimer class:

```python
def start(self):
    self.is_running = True
    focus_sessions = 0
    while self.remaining_time > 0:
        self.remaining_time -= 1
        time.sleep(1)
        if self.remaining_time == 0:
            if focus_sessions < 3:
                self.remaining_time = self.short_break_duration
                focus_sessions += 1
            else:
                self.remaining_time = self.long_break_duration
                focus_sessions = 0
    self.is_running = False
```

This updated code will handle the breaks and longer breaks according to the requirements.

Please make the necessary changes and ensure that the code meets all the regulations mentioned."

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the methods in the TaskManager class. Specifically, the add_task, remove_task, and get_tasks methods need to be implemented. Additionally, the code does not include any logic for blocking distracting websites and applications during focus sessions, as mentioned in the task requirements. 

To fix this, you need to add the following methods to the TaskManager class:

```python
def add_task(self, task):
    self.tasks.append(task)

def remove_task(self, task):
    self.tasks.remove(task)

def get_tasks(self):
    return self.tasks
```

To implement the website and application blocking functionality, you will need to use platform-specific APIs or libraries to block access to specific websites and applications during focus sessions. This will require additional research and implementation.

Once you have made these changes, the code will meet the requirements specified in the task.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the methods in the TaskManager class. Specifically, the add_task, remove_task, and get_tasks methods need to be implemented. Additionally, the code does not include any logic for blocking distracting websites and applications during focus sessions, as mentioned in the task requirements. 

To fix this, you need to add the following methods to the TaskManager class:

```python
def add_task(self, task):
    self.tasks.append(task)

def remove_task(self, task):
    self.tasks.remove(task)

def get_tasks(self):
    return self.tasks
```

To implement the website and application blocking functionality, you will need to use platform-specific APIs or libraries to block access to specific websites and applications during focus sessions. This will require additional research and implementation.

Once you have made these changes, the code will meet the requirements specified in the task."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the methods in the TaskManager class. Specifically, the add_task, remove_task, and get_tasks methods need to be implemented. Additionally, the code does not include any logic for blocking distracting websites and applications during focus sessions, as mentioned in the task requirements. 

To fix this, you need to add the implementation for the missing methods in the TaskManager class. You also need to add the necessary logic for blocking distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. This could be achieved by using platform-specific APIs or libraries to block access to certain websites or applications during the focus session.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the methods in the TaskManager class. Specifically, the add_task, remove_task, and get_tasks methods need to be implemented. Additionally, the code does not include any logic for blocking distracting websites and applications during focus sessions, as mentioned in the task requirements. 

To fix this, you need to add the implementation for the missing methods in the TaskManager class. You also need to add the necessary logic for blocking distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. This could be achieved by using platform-specific APIs or libraries to block access to certain websites or applications during the focus session."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

You are Counselor. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include asking what user and customer think and provide your valuable suggestions. 
Here is a new customer's task: "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

requirements.txt

```
numpy==1.19.2

### Track Tasks

FocusBlocks includes a task management feature that allows you to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track your progress over time. To use this feature, you can modify the `TaskManager` class in the `task_manager.py` file.
