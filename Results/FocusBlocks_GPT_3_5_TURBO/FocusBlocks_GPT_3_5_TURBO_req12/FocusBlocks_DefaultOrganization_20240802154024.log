REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).
REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.
REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file.
REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.
REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.
REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.
REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session.
REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule.
REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled.

I think the best product modality for FocusBlocks would be a combination of a web application and a mobile application. This would allow users to access the tool from their desktop or laptop computers as well as their smartphones or tablets, providing flexibility and convenience. Additionally, a web and mobile app would enable seamless synchronization of data across devices, ensuring that users can easily manage their tasks and focus sessions regardless of the device they are using.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).
REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.
REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file.
REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.
REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.
REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.
REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session.
REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule.
REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the implementation of the audio notification feature in the `PomodoroTimer` class. Currently, the code uses the `pygame` library to play the audio notification sound. However, the code does not handle the case when `pygame` library is not installed or when the audio file is not found.

To fix this, I would suggest the following revisions:
1. Add a try-except block around the code that initializes and plays the audio notification sound using `pygame`. In the except block, print an error message indicating the failure to play the audio notification and provide instructions to the user to install the `pygame` library if it is not already installed.
2. Additionally, handle the `pygame.error` exception separately and print an error message indicating the failure to play the audio notification due to an issue with the audio file.

These revisions will ensure that the code gracefully handles any errors related to playing the audio notification and provides informative error messages to the user.

Please make the necessary revisions and test the audio notification feature to ensure it works correctly.

However, the code does not handle the case when pygame library is not installed or when the audio file is not found.\n\nTo fix this, I would suggest the following revisions:\n1. Add a try-except block around the code that initializes and plays the audio notification sound using pygame. In the except block, print an error message indicating the failure to play the audio notification and provide instructions to the user to install the pygame library if it is not already installed.\n2. Additionally, handle the pygame.error exception separately and print an error message indicating the failure to play the audio notification due to an issue with the audio file.\n\nThese revisions will ensure that the code gracefully handles any errors related to playing the audio notification and provides informative error messages to the user.\n\nPlease make the necessary revisions and test the audio notification feature to ensure it works correctly.'} |

| **task_prompt** | "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time. REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique. REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included. REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break. REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services). REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list. REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file. REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session. REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status. REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session. REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session. REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule. REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled. |

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the implementation of the audio notification feature in the `PomodoroTimer` class. Currently, the code uses the `pygame` library to play the audio notification sound. However, the code does not handle the case when `pygame` library is not installed or when the audio file is not found.

To fix this, I would suggest the following revisions:
1. Add a try-except block around the code that initializes and plays the audio notification sound using `pygame`. In the except block, print an error message indicating the failure to play the audio notification and provide instructions to the user to install the `pygame` library if it is not already installed.
2. Additionally, handle the `pygame.error` exception separately and print an error message indicating the failure to play the audio notification due to an issue with the audio file.

These revisions will ensure that the code gracefully handles any errors related to playing the audio notification and provides informative error messages to the user.

Please make the necessary revisions and test the audio notification feature to ensure it works correctly."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).
REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.
REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file.
REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.
REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.
REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.
REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session.
REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule.
REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **task_prompt** | "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time. REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique. REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included. REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break. REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services). REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list. REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file. REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session. REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status. REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session. REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session. REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule. REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled. |

Add a try-except block around the code that initializes and plays the audio notification sound using pygame. In the except block, print an error message indicating the failure to play the audio notification and provide instructions to the user to install the pygame library if it is not already installed.\n2. Additionally, handle the pygame.error exception separately and print an error message indicating the failure to play the audio notification due to an issue with the audio file.\n\nThese revisions will ensure that the code gracefully handles any errors related to playing the audio notification and provides informative error messages to the user.\n\nPlease make the necessary revisions and test the audio notification feature to ensure it works correctly.'} |

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).
REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.
REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file.
REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.
REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.
REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.
REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session.
REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule.
REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the implementation of the audio notification feature in the `PomodoroTimer` class. Currently, the code uses the `pygame` library to play the audio notification sound. However, the code does not handle the case when `pygame` library is not installed or when the audio file is not found.

To fix this, we can add error handling and provide appropriate error messages to the user. Additionally, we can consider using a different audio library that is more lightweight and does not require external dependencies.

Here's the revised code for the `play_notification` method in the `PomodoroTimer` class:

```python
def play_notification(self, message):
    # Replace with actual code to display visual notification
    print(message)
    # Replace with code to play audio notification
    try:
        pygame.mixer.init()
        pygame.mixer.music.load(self.audio_notification_sound)
        pygame.mixer.music.play()
    except ImportError:
        print("Error: Failed to play audio notification. Please make sure pygame library is installed.")
    except pygame.error:
        print("Error: Failed to play audio notification. Please check the audio file.")
```

With this revision, the code will handle the cases when `pygame` library is not installed or when the audio file is not found, and provide appropriate error messages to the user.

The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.\nREQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.\nREQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.\nREQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it\'s time for a break.\nREQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).\nREQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.\nREQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application\'s executable file.\nREQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.\nREQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.\nREQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.\nREQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session.\nREQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule.\nREQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled.', 'modality': 'web and mobile application', 'ideas': '', 'language': ' Python', 'codes': 'task_manager.py\npython\n\'\'\'\nFocusBlocks -

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the implementation of the audio notification feature in the `PomodoroTimer` class. Currently, the code uses the `pygame` library to play the audio notification sound. However, the code does not handle the case when `pygame` library is not installed or when the audio file is not found.

To fix this, we can add error handling and provide appropriate error messages to the user. Additionally, we can consider using a different audio library that is more lightweight and does not require external dependencies.

Here's the revised code for the `play_notification` method in the `PomodoroTimer` class:

```python
def play_notification(self, message):
    # Replace with actual code to display visual notification
    print(message)
    # Replace with code to play audio notification
    try:
        pygame.mixer.init()
        pygame.mixer.music.load(self.audio_notification_sound)
        pygame.mixer.music.play()
    except ImportError:
        print("Error: Failed to play audio notification. Please make sure pygame library is installed.")
    except pygame.error:
        print("Error: Failed to play audio notification. Please check the audio file.")
```

With this revision, the code will handle the cases when `pygame` library is not installed or when the audio file is not found, and provide appropriate error messages to the user."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).
REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.
REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file.
REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.
REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.
REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.
REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session.
REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule.
REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **task_prompt** | "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time. REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique. REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included. REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break. REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services). REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list. REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file. REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session. REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status. REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session. REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session. REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule. REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled. |

| **task_prompt** | "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time. REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique. REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included. REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break. REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services). REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.

REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session. REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule. REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled. |

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).
REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.
REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file.
REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.
REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.
REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.
REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session.
REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule.
REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the implementation of the audio notification feature in the `PomodoroTimer` class. Currently, the code uses the `pygame` library to play the audio notification sound. However, the code does not handle the case when the `pygame` library is not installed or when there is an error playing the audio file.

To fix this, we can add error handling and provide appropriate error messages to the user. Additionally, we can consider using a different library or approach for playing audio notifications to ensure compatibility across different platforms.

Here's the revised code for the `play_notification` method in the `PomodoroTimer` class:

```python
def play_notification(self, message):
    # Replace with actual code to display visual notification
    print(message)
    # Replace with code to play audio notification
    try:
        pygame.mixer.init()
        pygame.mixer.music.load(self.audio_notification_sound)
        pygame.mixer.music.play()
    except ImportError:
        print("Error: Failed to play audio notification. Please make sure pygame library is installed.")
    except pygame.error:
        print("Error: Failed to play audio notification. Please check the audio file.")
```

Please make the necessary changes to the code.

The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.\nREQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.\nREQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.\nREQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it\'s time for a break.\nREQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).\nREQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.\nREQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application\'s executable file.\nREQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.\nREQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.\nREQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.\nREQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session.\nREQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule.\nREQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled.', 'modality': 'web and mobile application', 'ideas': '', 'language': ' Python', 'codes': 'task_manager.py\npython\n\'\'\'\nFocusBlocks -

Additionally, we can consider using a different library or approach for playing audio notifications to ensure compatibility across different platforms.\n\nHere\'s the revised code for the play_notification method in the PomodoroTimer class:\n\npython\ndef play_notification(self, message):\n    # Replace with actual code to display visual notification\n    print(message)\n    # Replace with code to play audio notification\n    try:\n        pygame.mixer.init()\n        pygame.mixer.music.load(self.audio_notification_sound)\n        pygame.mixer.music.play()\n    except ImportError:\n        print("Error: Failed to play audio notification. Please make sure pygame library is installed.")\n    except pygame.error:\n        print("Error: Failed to play audio notification. Please check the audio file.")\n\n\nPlease make the necessary changes to the code.'} |

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the implementation of the audio notification feature in the `PomodoroTimer` class. Currently, the code uses the `pygame` library to play the audio notification sound. However, the code does not handle the case when the `pygame` library is not installed or when there is an error playing the audio file.

To fix this, we can add error handling and provide appropriate error messages to the user. Additionally, we can consider using a different library or approach for playing audio notifications to ensure compatibility across different platforms.

Here's the revised code for the `play_notification` method in the `PomodoroTimer` class:

```python
def play_notification(self, message):
    # Replace with actual code to display visual notification
    print(message)
    # Replace with code to play audio notification
    try:
        pygame.mixer.init()
        pygame.mixer.music.load(self.audio_notification_sound)
        pygame.mixer.music.play()
    except ImportError:
        print("Error: Failed to play audio notification. Please make sure pygame library is installed.")
    except pygame.error:
        print("Error: Failed to play audio notification. Please check the audio file.")
```

Please make the necessary changes to the code."

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).
REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.
REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file.
REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.
REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.
REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.
REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session.
REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule.
REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

| **task_prompt** | "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time. REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique. REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included. REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break. REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services). REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list. REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file. REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session. REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status. REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session. REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session. REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule. REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled. |

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).
REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.
REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file.
REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.
REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.
REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.
REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session.
REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule.
REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly, you can create a requirements.txt file in the following format:

requirements.txt

```
pygame==2.0.1
```

In this case, the only dependency required for the project is the `pygame` package, which is used for playing audio notifications.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: To specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly, you can create a requirements.txt file in the following format:
requirements.txt
```
pygame==2.0.1
```
In this case, the only dependency required for the project is the `pygame` package, which is used for playing audio notifications. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Counselor. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include asking what user and customer think and provide your valuable suggestions. 
Here is a new customer's task: "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).
REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.
REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file.
REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.
REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.
REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.
REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session.
REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule.
REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

For example: manual.md ``` LangChain Building applications with LLMs through composability Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js. Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel. Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new customer's task: "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).
REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.
REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file.
REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.
REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.
REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.
REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session.
REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule.
REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]
