Here is a new customer's task: "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).
REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.
REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file.
REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.
REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.
REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.
REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Modality: "web application".

Ideas: "".

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the implementation of the audio notification feature in the `PomodoroTimer` class. Currently, the code uses the `pygame` library to play audio notifications, but it does not handle the case when `pygame` is not installed or when the audio file is missing. This can lead to errors and unexpected behavior for users who do not have `pygame` installed or when the audio file is not found.

To address this, I suggest the following revisions:

1. Add error handling for the case when `pygame` is not installed or when the audio file is missing. You can use a try-except block to catch any `ImportError` or `pygame.error` and print an error message instead of playing the audio notification.

Here's an example of how the `play_notification` method can be updated:

```python
def play_notification(self, message):
    # Replace with actual code to display visual notification
    print(message)
    # Replace with code to play audio notification
    try:
        pygame.mixer.init()
        pygame.mixer.music.load(self.audio_notification_sound)
        pygame.mixer.music.play()
    except (ImportError, pygame.error):
        print("Error: Failed to play audio notification. Please check the audio file or make sure pygame library is installed.")
```

By adding this error handling, the application will gracefully handle the case when `pygame` is not installed or when the audio file is missing, and provide a clear error message to the user.

Please make the necessary revisions to the code and ensure that the error handling is implemented correctly.

This can lead to errors and unexpected behavior for users who do not have pygame installed or when the audio file is not found.\n\nTo address this, I suggest the following revisions:\n\n1. Add error handling for the case when pygame is not installed or when the audio file is missing. You can use a try-except block to catch any ImportError or pygame.error and print an error message instead of playing the audio notification.\n\nHere\'s an example of how the play_notification method can be updated:\n\npython\ndef play_notification(self, message):\n    # Replace with actual code to display visual notification\n    print(message)\n    # Replace with code to play audio notification\n    try:\n        pygame.mixer.init()\n        pygame.mixer.music.load(self.audio_notification_sound)\n        pygame.mixer.music.play()\n    except (ImportError, pygame.error):\n        print("Error: Failed to play audio notification. Please check the audio file or make sure pygame library is installed.")\n\n\nBy adding this error handling, the application will gracefully handle the case when pygame is not installed or when the audio file is missing, and provide a clear error message to the user.\n\nPlease make the necessary revisions to the code and ensure that the error handling is implemented correctly.'} |

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the implementation of the audio notification feature in the `PomodoroTimer` class. Currently, the code uses the `pygame` library to play audio notifications, but it does not handle the case when `pygame` is not installed or when the audio file is missing. This can lead to errors and unexpected behavior for users who do not have `pygame` installed or when the audio file is not found.

To address this, I suggest the following revisions:

1. Add error handling for the case when `pygame` is not installed or when the audio file is missing. You can use a try-except block to catch any `ImportError` or `pygame.error` and print an error message instead of playing the audio notification.

Here's an example of how the `play_notification` method can be updated:

```python
def play_notification(self, message):
    # Replace with actual code to display visual notification
    print(message)
    # Replace with code to play audio notification
    try:
        pygame.mixer.init()
        pygame.mixer.music.load(self.audio_notification_sound)
        pygame.mixer.music.play()
    except (ImportError, pygame.error):
        print("Error: Failed to play audio notification. Please check the audio file or make sure pygame library is installed.")
```

By adding this error handling, the application will gracefully handle the case when `pygame` is not installed or when the audio file is missing, and provide a clear error message to the user.

Please make the necessary revisions to the code and ensure that the error handling is implemented correctly."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).
REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.
REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file.
REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.
REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.
REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.
REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **task_prompt** | "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time. REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique. REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included. REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break. REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services). REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list. REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file. REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session. REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status. REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session. REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session. |

Currently, the code uses the pygame library to play audio notifications, but it does not handle the case when pygame is not installed or when the audio file is missing. This can lead to errors and unexpected behavior for users who do not have pygame installed or when the audio file is not found.\n\nTo address this, I suggest the following revisions:\n\n1. Add error handling for the case when pygame is not installed or when the audio file is missing. You can use a try-except block to catch any ImportError or pygame.error and print an error message instead of playing the audio notification.\n\nHere\'s an example of how the play_notification method can be updated:\n\npython\ndef play_notification(self, message):\n    # Replace with actual code to display visual notification\n    print(message)\n    # Replace with code to play audio notification\n    try:\n        pygame.mixer.init()\n        pygame.mixer.music.load(self.audio_notification_sound)\n        pygame.mixer.music.play()\n    except (ImportError, pygame.error):\n        print("Error: Failed to play audio notification. Please check the audio file or make sure pygame library is installed.")\n\n\nBy adding this error handling, the application will gracefully handle the case when pygame is not installed or when the audio file is missing, and provide a clear error message to the user.\n\nPlease make the necessary revisions to the code and ensure that the error handling is implemented correctly.'} |

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the implementation of the audio notification feature in the `PomodoroTimer` class. Currently, the code uses the `pygame` library to play the audio notification sound. However, the code does not handle the case when `pygame` library is not installed or when there is an error playing the audio file.

To fix this, we can modify the `play_notification` method to handle these cases and provide appropriate error messages. Additionally, we can add a parameter to the `PomodoroTimer` class constructor to allow users to specify the audio notification sound file.

Here's the revised code for the `PomodoroTimer` class:

```python
import time
import platform
import threading
import pygame

class PomodoroTimer:
    def __init__(self, audio_notification_sound="notification.wav"):
        self.work_duration = 25 * 60  # 25 minutes in seconds
        self.short_break_duration = 5 * 60  # 5 minutes in seconds
        self.long_break_duration = 15 * 60  # 15 minutes in seconds
        self.remaining_time = self.work_duration
        self.is_running = False
        self.focus_sessions = 0
        self.timer = None
        self.audio_notification_enabled = True
        self.audio_notification_sound = audio_notification_sound

    def start(self):
        if self.is_running:
            return
        self.is_running = True
        self.timer = threading.Timer(self.remaining_time, self._session_end_callback)
        self.timer.start()
        self.play_notification("Session started!")

    def pause(self):
        if not self.is_running:
            return
        self.is_running = False
        self.timer.cancel()
        self.play_notification("Session paused!")

    def stop(self):
        if not self.is_running:
            return
        self.is_running = False
        self.timer.cancel()
        self.remaining_time = self.work_duration

Instructions for revision:
1. Import the `pygame` library at the top of the `pomodoro.py` file.
2. Replace the existing `PomodoroTimer` class implementation with the revised code provided above.
3. Update the `main.py` file to pass the audio notification sound file path to the `PomodoroTimer` class constructor when creating an instance of the class.

Once these changes are made, the audio notification feature will handle cases where `pygame` library is not installed or when there is an error playing the audio file.

 <Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the implementation of the audio notification feature in the `PomodoroTimer` class. Currently, the code uses the `pygame` library to play the audio notification sound. However, the code does not handle the case when `pygame` library is not installed or when there is an error playing the audio file.

To fix this, we can modify the `play_notification` method to handle these cases and provide appropriate error messages. Additionally, we can add a parameter to the `PomodoroTimer` class constructor to allow users to specify the audio notification sound file.

Here's the revised code for the `PomodoroTimer` class:

```python
import time
import platform
import threading
import pygame

class PomodoroTimer:
    def __init__(self, audio_notification_sound="notification.wav"):
        self.work_duration = 25 * 60  # 25 minutes in seconds
        self.short_break_duration = 5 * 60  # 5 minutes in seconds
        self.long_break_duration = 15 * 60  # 15 minutes in seconds
        self.remaining_time = self.work_duration
        self.is_running = False
        self.focus_sessions = 0
        self.timer = None
        self.audio_notification_enabled = True
        self.audio_notification_sound = audio_notification_sound

    def start(self):
        if self.is_running:
            return
        self.is_running = True
        self.timer = threading.Timer(self.remaining_time, self._session_end_callback)
        self.timer.start()
        self.play_notification("Session started!")

    def pause(self):
        if not self.is_running:
            return
        self.is_running = False
        self.timer.cancel()
        self.play_notification("Session paused!")

    def stop(self):
        if not self.is_running:
            return
        self.is_running = False
        self.timer.cancel()
        self.remaining_time = self.work_duration
        self.play_notification("Session stopped!")

    def set_work_duration(self, duration):
        self.work_duration = duration * 60

    def set_short_break_duration(self, duration):
        self.short_break_duration = duration * 60

    def set_long_break_duration(self, duration):
        self.long_break_duration = duration * 60

    def get_remaining_time(self):
        return self.remaining_time

    def _session_end_callback(self):
        if self.focus_sessions < 3:
            self.remaining_time = self.short_break_duration
            self.focus_sessions += 1
            self.play_notification("Break time!")
        else:
            self.remaining_time = self.long_break_duration
            self.focus_sessions = 0
            self.play_notification("Long break time!")
        self.start()

    def play_notification(self, message):
        # Replace with actual code to display visual notification
        print(message)
        # Replace with code to play audio notification
        try:
            pygame.mixer.init()
            pygame.mixer.music.load(self.audio_notification_sound)
            pygame.mixer.music.play()
        except ImportError:
            print("Error: Failed to play audio notification. Please make sure pygame library is installed.")
        except pygame.error:
            print("Error: Failed to play audio notification. Please check the audio file.")

| --- | --- |
| **task_prompt** | "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time. REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique. REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included. REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break. REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services). REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list. REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file. REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session. REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status. REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session. REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session. |

Currently, the code uses the pygame library to play the audio notification sound. However, the code does not handle the case when pygame library is not installed or when there is an error playing the audio file.\n\nTo fix this, we can modify the play_notification method to handle these cases and provide appropriate error messages. Additionally, we can add a parameter to the PomodoroTimer class constructor to allow users to specify the audio notification sound file.\n\nHere\'s the revised code for the PomodoroTimer class:\n\npython\nimport time\nimport platform\nimport threading\nimport pygame\n\nclass PomodoroTimer:\n    def __init__(self, audio_notification_sound="notification.wav"):\n        self.work_duration = 25 * 60  # 25 minutes in seconds\n        self.short_break_duration = 5 * 60  # 5 minutes in seconds\n        self.long_break_duration = 15 * 60  # 15 minutes in seconds\n        self.remaining_time = self.work_duration\n        self.is_running = False\n        self.focus_sessions = 0\n        self.timer = None\n        self.audio_notification_enabled = True\n        self.audio_notification_sound = audio_notification_sound\n\n    def start(self):\n        if self.is_running:\n            return\n        self.is_running = True\n        self.timer = threading.Timer(self.remaining_time, self._session_end_callback)\n        self.timer.start()\n        self.play_notification("Session started!")\n\n    def pause(self):\n        if not self.is_running:\n            return\n        self.is_running = False\n        self.timer.cancel()\n        self.play_notification("Session paused!")\n\n    def stop(self):\n        if not self.is_running:\n            return\n        self.is_running = False\n        self.timer.cancel()\n        self.remaining_time = self.work_duration\n        self.play_notification("Session stopped!")\n\n    def set_work_duration(self, duration):\n        self.work_duration = duration * 60\n\n    def set_short_break_duration(self, duration):\n        self.short_break_duration = duration * 60\n\n    def set_long_break_duration(self, duration):\n        self.long_break_duration = duration * 60\n\n    def get_remaining_time(self):\n        return self.remaining_time\n\n    def _session_end_callback(self):\n        if self.focus_sessions &lt; 3:\n            self.remaining_time = self.short_break_duration\n            self.focus_sessions += 1\n            self.play_notification("Break time!")\n        else:\n            self.remaining_time = self.long_break_duration\n            self.focus_sessions = 0\n            self.play_notification("Long break time!")\n        self.start()\n\n    def play_notification(self, message):\n        # Replace with actual code to display visual notification\n        print(message)\n        # Replace with code to play audio notification\n        try:\n            pygame.mixer.init()\n            pygame.mixer.music.load(self.audio_notification_sound)\n            pygame.mixer.music.play()\n        except ImportError:\n            print("Error: Failed to play audio notification.

Please check the audio file.")\n\n\n\nInstructions for revision:\n1. Import the pygame library at the top of the pomodoro.py file.\n2. Replace the existing PomodoroTimer class implementation with the revised code provided above.\n3. Update the main.py file to pass the audio notification sound file path to the PomodoroTimer class constructor when creating an instance of the class.\n\nOnce these changes are made, the audio notification feature will handle cases where pygame library is not installed or when there is an error playing the audio file.'} |

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the implementation of the audio notification feature in the `PomodoroTimer` class. Currently, the code uses the `pygame` library to play the audio notification sound. However, the code does not handle the case when `pygame` library is not installed or when there is an error playing the audio file.

To fix this, we can modify the `play_notification` method to handle these cases and provide appropriate error messages. Additionally, we can add a parameter to the `PomodoroTimer` class constructor to allow users to specify the audio notification sound file.

Here's the revised code for the `PomodoroTimer` class:

```python
import time
import platform
import threading
import pygame

class PomodoroTimer:
    def __init__(self, audio_notification_sound="notification.wav"):
        self.work_duration = 25 * 60  # 25 minutes in seconds
        self.short_break_duration = 5 * 60  # 5 minutes in seconds
        self.long_break_duration = 15 * 60  # 15 minutes in seconds
        self.remaining_time = self.work_duration
        self.is_running = False
        self.focus_sessions = 0
        self.timer = None
        self.audio_notification_enabled = True
        self.audio_notification_sound = audio_notification_sound

    def start(self):
        if self.is_running:
            return
        self.is_running = True
        self.timer = threading.Timer(self.remaining_time, self._session_end_callback)
        self.timer.start()
        self.play_notification("Session started!")

    def pause(self):
        if not self.is_running:
            return
        self.is_running = False
        self.timer.cancel()
        self.play_notification("Session paused!")

    def stop(self):
        if not self.is_running:
            return
        self.is_running = False
        self.timer.cancel()
        self.remaining_time = self.work_duration
        self.play_notification("Session stopped!")

    def set_work_duration(self, duration):
        self.work_duration = duration * 60

    def set_short_break_duration(self, duration):
        self.short_break_duration = duration * 60

    def set_long_break_duration(self, duration):
        self.long_break_duration = duration * 60

    def get_remaining_time(self):
        return self.remaining_time

    def _session_end_callback(self):
        if self.focus_sessions < 3:
            self.remaining_time = self.short_break_duration
            self.focus_sessions += 1
            self.play_notification("Break time!")
        else:
            self.remaining_time = self.long_break_duration
            self.focus_sessions = 0
            self.play_notification("Long break time!")
        self.start()

    def play_notification(self, message):
        # Replace with actual code to display visual notification
        print(message)
        # Replace with code to play audio notification
        try:
            pygame.mixer.init()
            pygame.mixer.music.load(self.audio_notification_sound)
            pygame.mixer.music.play()
        except ImportError:
            print("Error: Failed to play audio notification. Please make sure pygame library is installed.")
        except pygame.error:
            print("Error: Failed to play audio notification. Please check the audio file.")

```

Instructions for revision:
1. Import the `pygame` library at the top of the `pomodoro.py` file.
2. Replace the existing `PomodoroTimer` class implementation with the revised code provided above.
3. Update the `main.py` file to pass the audio notification sound file path to the `PomodoroTimer` class constructor when creating an instance of the class.

Once these changes are made, the audio notification feature will handle cases where `pygame` library is not installed or when there is an error playing the audio file."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).
REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.
REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file.
REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.
REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.
REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.
REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **task_prompt** | "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time. REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique. REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included. REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break. REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services). REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list. REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file. REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session. REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status. REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session. REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session. |

The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.\nREQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.\nREQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.\nREQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it\'s time for a break.\nREQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).\nREQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.\nREQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application\'s executable file.\nREQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.\nREQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.\nREQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.\nREQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session.', 'modality': 'web application', 'ideas': '', 'language': ' Python', 'codes': 'task_manager.py\npython\n\'\'\'\nFocusBlocks -

Currently, the code uses the pygame library to play the audio notification sound.

Additionally, we can add a parameter to the PomodoroTimer class constructor to allow users to specify the audio notification sound file.\n\nHere\'s the revised code for the PomodoroTimer class:\n\npython\nimport time\nimport platform\nimport threading\nimport pygame\n\nclass PomodoroTimer:\n    def __init__(self, audio_notification_sound="notification.wav"):\n        self.work_duration = 25 * 60  # 25 minutes in seconds\n        self.short_break_duration = 5 * 60  # 5 minutes in seconds\n        self.long_break_duration = 15 * 60  # 15 minutes in seconds\n        self.remaining_time = self.work_duration\n        self.is_running = False\n        self.focus_sessions = 0\n        self.timer = None\n        self.audio_notification_enabled = True\n        self.audio_notification_sound = audio_notification_sound\n\n    def start(self):\n        if self.is_running:\n            return\n        self.is_running = True\n        self.timer = threading.Timer(self.remaining_time, self._session_end_callback)\n        self.timer.start()\n        self.play_notification("Session started!")\n\n    def pause(self):\n        if not self.is_running:\n            return\n        self.is_running = False\n        self.timer.cancel()\n        self.play_notification("Session paused!")\n\n    def stop(self):\n        if not self.is_running:\n            return\n        self.is_running = False\n        self.timer.cancel()\n        self.remaining_time = self.work_duration\n        self.play_notification("Session stopped!")\n\n    def set_work_duration(self, duration):\n        self.work_duration = duration * 60\n\n    def set_short_break_duration(self, duration):\n        self.short_break_duration = duration * 60\n\n    def set_long_break_duration(self, duration):\n        self.long_break_duration = duration * 60\n\n    def get_remaining_time(self):\n        return self.remaining_time\n\n    def _session_end_callback(self):\n        if self.focus_sessions &lt; 3:\n            self.remaining_time = self.short_break_duration\n            self.focus_sessions += 1\n            self.play_notification("Break time!")\n        else:\n            self.remaining_time = self.long_break_duration\n            self.focus_sessions = 0\n            self.play_notification("Long break time!")\n        self.start()\n\n    def play_notification(self, message):\n        # Replace with actual code to display visual notification\n        print(message)\n        # Replace with code to play audio notification\n        try:\n            pygame.mixer.init()\n            pygame.mixer.music.load(self.audio_notification_sound)\n            pygame.mixer.music.play()\n        except ImportError:\n            print("Error: Failed to play audio notification. Please make sure pygame library is installed.")\n        except pygame.error:\n            print("Error: Failed to play audio notification. Please check the audio file.")\n\n\n\nInstructions for revision:\n1. Import the pygame library at the top of the pomodoro.py file.\n2. Replace the existing PomodoroTimer class implementation with the revised code provided above.\n3. Update the main.py file to pass the audio notification sound file path to the PomodoroTimer class constructor when creating an instance of the class.\n\nOnce these changes are made, the audio notification feature will handle cases where pygame library is not installed or when there is an error playing the audio file.'} |

<COMMENT>
The highest priority comment is related to the implementation of the audio notification feature in the `PomodoroTimer` class. Currently, the code uses the `pygame` library to play the audio notification sound. However, the code does not handle the case when `pygame` library is not installed or when the audio file is not found.

<SUGGESTION>
To address this issue, you can modify the `play_notification` method to handle these error cases and provide appropriate error messages. Here's an updated version of the `play_notification` method:

```python
def play_notification(self, message):
    # Replace with actual code to display visual notification
    print(message)
    
    try:
        pygame.mixer.init()
        pygame.mixer.music.load(self.audio_notification_sound)
        pygame.mixer.music.play()
    except ImportError:
        print("Error: Failed to play audio notification. Please make sure pygame library is installed.")
    except pygame.error:
        print("Error: Failed to play audio notification. Please check the audio file.")
```

This updated code will catch the `ImportError` if `pygame` library is not installed and the `pygame.error` if the audio file is not found. It will print appropriate error messages in both cases.

Please make this modification in the `pomodoro.py` file and ensure that the code handles these error cases correctly.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The highest priority comment is related to the implementation of the audio notification feature in the `PomodoroTimer` class. Currently, the code uses the `pygame` library to play the audio notification sound. However, the code does not handle the case when `pygame` library is not installed or when the audio file is not found.

<SUGGESTION>
To address this issue, you can modify the `play_notification` method to handle these error cases and provide appropriate error messages. Here's an updated version of the `play_notification` method:

```python
def play_notification(self, message):
    # Replace with actual code to display visual notification
    print(message)
    
    try:
        pygame.mixer.init()
        pygame.mixer.music.load(self.audio_notification_sound)
        pygame.mixer.music.play()
    except ImportError:
        print("Error: Failed to play audio notification. Please make sure pygame library is installed.")
    except pygame.error:
        print("Error: Failed to play audio notification. Please check the audio file.")
```

This updated code will catch the `ImportError` if `pygame` library is not installed and the `pygame.error` if the audio file is not found. It will print appropriate error messages in both cases.

Please make this modification in the `pomodoro.py` file and ensure that the code handles these error cases correctly."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).
REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.
REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file.
REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.
REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.
REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.
REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

| --- | --- |
| **task_prompt** | "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time. REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique. REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included. REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break. REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services). REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list. REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file. REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session. REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status. REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session. REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session. |

| **task_prompt** | "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time. REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique. REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included. REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break. REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services). REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list. REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file. REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session. REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status. REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session. REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session. |

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).
REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.
REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file.
REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.
REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.
REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.
REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly, you can create a requirements.txt file and list the necessary packages and their versions. Based on the provided codes, here is an example of a requirements.txt file:

requirements.txt

```
pygame==2.0.1
```

In this example, the only package required is pygame, which is used for playing audio notifications in the Pomodoro timer functionality. The version specified is 2.0.1, but you can adjust it based on the specific version you want to use or the compatibility requirements of your project.

Please note that this is a simplified example and you may need to add more dependencies to the requirements.txt file based on the specific requirements of your project.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: To specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly, you can create a requirements.txt file and list the necessary packages and their versions. Based on the provided codes, here is an example of a requirements.txt file:
requirements.txt
```
pygame==2.0.1
```
In this example, the only package required is pygame, which is used for playing audio notifications in the Pomodoro timer functionality. The version specified is 2.0.1, but you can adjust it based on the specific version you want to use or the compatibility requirements of your project.
Please note that this is a simplified example and you may need to add more dependencies to the requirements.txt file based on the specific requirements of your project. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Counselor. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include asking what user and customer think and provide your valuable suggestions. 
Here is a new customer's task: "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).
REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.
REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file.
REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.
REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.
REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.
REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Programming Language: "{language}" Ideas: "{ideas}" Codes:  "{codes}" Requirements: "{requirements}" As the {assistant_role}, by using Markdown, you should write a manual.md file which is a detailed user manual to use the software, including introducing main functions of the software, how to install environment dependencies and how to use/play it. For example: manual.md ``` LangChain Building applications with LLMs through composability Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js. Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel. Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation
