<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `PomodoroTimer` class in `pomodoro.py` does not have methods for customizing the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, as required by REQ2. To fix this, you need to add setter methods for these durations and update the `start` method to use the customized durations instead of the default values.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `PomodoroTimer` class in `pomodoro.py` does not have methods for customizing the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, as required by REQ2. To fix this, you need to add setter methods for these durations and update the `start` method to use the customized durations instead of the default values."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `PomodoroTimer` class is missing the implementation of the `get_remaining_time` method. This method is necessary for the user to be able to see the remaining time of the current focus session or break. To fix this, you need to add the `get_remaining_time` method to the `PomodoroTimer` class.

Here is the revised code for the `pomodoro.py` file with the `get_remaining_time` method added:

```python

 <Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `PomodoroTimer` class is missing the implementation of the `get_remaining_time` method. This method is necessary for the user to be able to see the remaining time of the current focus session or break. To fix this, you need to add the `get_remaining_time` method to the `PomodoroTimer` class.

Here is the revised code for the `pomodoro.py` file with the `get_remaining_time` method added:

```python
'''
FocusBlocks - Pomodoro Technique with Website and Application Blocking
This file contains the Pomodoro timer functionality.

        self.long_break_duration = 15 * 60  # 15 minutes in seconds
        self.remaining_time = self.work_duration

            if self.is_running:
                self.remaining_time -= 1
            time.sleep(1)
            if self.remaining_time == 0:
                if self.focus_sessions < 3:

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `PomodoroTimer` class is missing the implementation of the `get_remaining_time` method. This method is necessary for the user to be able to see the remaining time of the current focus session or break. To fix this, you need to add the `get_remaining_time` method to the `PomodoroTimer` class.

Here is the revised code for the `pomodoro.py` file with the `get_remaining_time` method added:

```python
'''

        self.short_break_duration = 5 * 60  # 5 minutes in seconds
        self.long_break_duration = 15 * 60  # 15 minutes in seconds
        self.remaining_time = self.work_duration
        self.is_running = False
        self.focus_sessions = 0
    def start(self):
        self.is_running = True
        while self.remaining_time > 0:
            if self.is_running:
                self.remaining_time -= 1
            time.sleep(1)
            if self.remaining_time == 0:
                if self.focus_sessions < 3:
                    self.remaining_time = self.short_break_duration
                    self.focus_sessions += 1
                    self.play_notification("Break time!")
                else:
                    self.remaining_time = self.long_break_duration
                    self.focus_sessions = 0
                    self.play_notification("Long break time!")
        self.is_running = False
    def pause(self):
        self.is_running = False

        if platform.system() == 'Windows':
            winsound.Beep(1000, 1000)  # Replace with actual code to play audio notification
```

Please add the `get_remaining_time` method to the `PomodoroTimer` class in the `pomodoro.py` file."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the methods in the TaskManager class. Additionally, the main.py file does not include any functionality related to task management. To fix this, you need to implement the missing methods in the TaskManager class and add the necessary functionality in the main.py file to interact with the TaskManager class.

Here are the suggested revisions:

1) In task_manager.py, implement the following methods in the TaskManager class:
   - `add_task`: This method should add a task to the list of tasks.
   - `remove_task`: This method should remove a task from the list of tasks.
   - `get_tasks`: This method should return the list of tasks.

2) In main.py, add the following functionality related to task management:
   - Create an instance of the TaskManager class.
   - Implement functions to add and remove tasks using the TaskManager instance.
   - Implement a function to get the list of tasks using the TaskManager instance.

Once you have made these revisions, the code will be in compliance with the regulations and will include the necessary functionality for task management.

   - `get_tasks`: This method should return the list of tasks.

2) In main.py, add the following functionality related to task management:
   - Create an instance of the TaskManager class.
   - Implement functions to add and remove tasks using the TaskManager instance.
   - Implement a function to get the list of tasks using the TaskManager instance.

Once you have made these revisions, the code will be in compliance with the regulations and will include the necessary functionality for task management.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the methods in the TaskManager class. Additionally, the main.py file does not include any functionality related to task management. To fix this, you need to implement the missing methods in the TaskManager class and add the necessary functionality in the main.py file to interact with the TaskManager class.

Here are the suggested revisions:

1) In task_manager.py, implement the following methods in the TaskManager class:
   - `add_task`: This method should add a task to the list of tasks.
   - `remove_task`: This method should remove a task from the list of tasks.
   - `get_tasks`: This method should return the list of tasks.

2) In main.py, add the following functionality related to task management:
   - Create an instance of the TaskManager class.
   - Implement functions to add and remove tasks using the TaskManager instance.
   - Implement a function to get the list of tasks using the TaskManager instance.

Once you have made these revisions, the code will be in compliance with the regulations and will include the necessary functionality for task management."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services)..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services)..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly, you can create a requirements.txt file in the following format:

requirements.txt

```
pyqt5==5.15.2
pandas==1.3.3
numpy==1.21.2
```

In this example, I have included three dependencies: PyQt5, pandas, and numpy. You can modify this file to include any additional dependencies that are required for your project.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: To specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly, you can create a requirements.txt file in the following format:
requirements.txt
```
pyqt5==5.15.2
pandas==1.3.3
numpy==1.21.2
```
In this example, I have included three dependencies: PyQt5, pandas, and numpy. You can modify this file to include any additional dependencies that are required for your project. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

You are Counselor. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include asking what user and customer think and provide your valuable suggestions. 
Here is a new customer's task: "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services)..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Chief Executive Officer: Thank you for providing the requirements.txt file. I have reviewed it and it looks good. It includes the necessary dependencies for the project to run properly.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)
