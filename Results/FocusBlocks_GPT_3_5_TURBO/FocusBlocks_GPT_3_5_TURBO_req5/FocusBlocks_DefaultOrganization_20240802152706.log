Excellent! With the decision made to develop FocusBlocks as a web application, we can now start planning the implementation. Here's an outline of the solution:

1. Front-end Development:
   - Design a user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Implement the Pomodoro timer with start, pause, and stop functionality.
   - Allow users to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals.
   - Display visual and audio notifications for session start, end, and break time.

2. Back-end Development:
   - Create a server-side application using a web framework like Django or Flask.
   - Implement user authentication and session management.
   - Develop functionality to add and remove distracting websites and applications from the block list.
   - Integrate with a database to store user preferences and task information.

3. Task Management:
   - Provide a user-friendly interface for users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session.
   - Implement progress tracking to help users monitor their task completion over time.
   - Allow users to set longer breaks after a certain number of focus sessions.

4. Distracting Website and Application Blocker:
   - Develop a mechanism to block access to user-customizable list of distracting websites and applications during focus sessions.
   - Implement a browser extension or use DNS-based blocking to enforce the block list.

5. Testing and Deployment:
   - Conduct thorough testing to ensure the application functions as expected.
   - Deploy the web application to a hosting platform or server for public access.

By following this plan, we can create a robust and user-friendly web application that meets the requirements of FocusBlocks. Let's get started with the development process!

Back-end Development:\n   - Create a server-side application using a web framework like Django or Flask.\n   - Implement user authentication and session management.\n   - Develop functionality to add and remove distracting websites and applications from the block list.\n   - Integrate with a database to store user preferences and task information.\n3. Task Management:\n   - Provide a user-friendly interface for users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session.\n   - Implement progress tracking to help users monitor their task completion over time.\n   - Allow users to set longer breaks after a certain number of focus sessions.\n4. Distracting Website and Application Blocker:\n   - Develop a mechanism to block access to user-customizable list of distracting websites and applications during focus sessions.\n   - Implement a browser extension or use DNS-based blocking to enforce the block list.\n5. Testing and Deployment:\n   - Conduct thorough testing to ensure the application functions as expected.\n   - Deploy the web application to a hosting platform or server for public access.\nBy following this plan, we can create a robust and user-friendly web application that meets the requirements of FocusBlocks.

As the Chief Product Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and the product should be realizable, you should keep discussing with me to decide which product modality do we want the product to be?
Note that we must ONLY discuss the product modality and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion by replying with only one line, which starts with a single word <INFO>, followed by our final product modality without any other words, e.g., "<INFO> PowerPoint".

Chief Product Officer: I think the best product modality for FocusBlocks would be a web application. It would allow users to access the tool from any device with an internet connection, making it convenient and accessible. Additionally, a web application would provide a user-friendly interface for managing tasks, customizing focus sessions, and blocking distracting websites and applications.

Chief Executive Officer: I agree with your suggestion. A web application would indeed be the best product modality for FocusBlocks. It offers the flexibility and accessibility that users need, allowing them to use the tool on any device with an internet connection. Additionally, a web application can provide a user-friendly interface for managing tasks, customizing focus sessions, and blocking distracting websites and applications. Let's proceed with developing FocusBlocks as a web application. <INFO> Web Application

Chief Product Officer: Great! I'm glad we agree on developing FocusBlocks as a web application. This modality will provide the flexibility and accessibility that our users need. We can leverage web technologies to create a user-friendly interface for managing tasks, customizing focus sessions, and blocking distracting websites and applications. Let's move forward with developing FocusBlocks as a web application. <INFO> Web Application

Chief Executive Officer: Excellent! With the decision made to develop FocusBlocks as a web application, we can now start planning the implementation. Here's an outline of the solution:
1. Front-end Development:
   - Design a user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Implement the Pomodoro timer with start, pause, and stop functionality.
   - Allow users to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals.
   - Display visual and audio notifications for session start, end, and break time.
2. Back-end Development:
   - Create a server-side application using a web framework like Django or Flask.
   - Implement user authentication and session management.
   - Develop functionality to add and remove distracting websites and applications from the block list.
   - Integrate with a database to store user preferences and task information.
3. Task Management:
   - Provide a user-friendly interface for users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session.
   - Implement progress tracking to help users monitor their task completion over time.
   - Allow users to set longer breaks after a certain number of focus sessions.
4. Distracting Website and Application Blocker:
   - Develop a mechanism to block access to user-customizable list of distracting websites and applications during focus sessions.
   - Implement a browser extension or use DNS-based blocking to enforce the block list.
5. Testing and Deployment:
   - Conduct thorough testing to ensure the application functions as expected.
   - Deploy the web application to a hosting platform or server for public access.

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).
REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the visual and audio notifications mentioned in REQ3. Currently, the `play_notification` method in the `PomodoroTimer` class only prints the notification message to the console. To fix this, you need to implement the actual code to display visual notifications and play audio notifications.

<SUGGESTION> Here are some suggestions to implement the visual and audio notifications:
1. Visual Notifications:
   - You can use a GUI library like Tkinter or PyQt to create a pop-up window or a notification banner that displays the notification message.
   - Alternatively, you can use a system tray notification to display the message.
   - Make sure to show the notifications when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.

2. Audio Notifications:
   - You can use a library like `pygame` or `playsound` to play audio files for the notifications.
   - Create audio files for the different notification messages (e.g., "Break time!", "Long break time!").
   - Play the corresponding audio file when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.

Remember to update the `play_notification` method in the `PomodoroTimer` class with the actual code to display visual notifications and play audio notifications.

Once you have implemented the visual and audio notifications, the code will meet the requirements mentioned in REQ3.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the visual and audio notifications mentioned in REQ3. Currently, the `play_notification` method in the `PomodoroTimer` class only prints the notification message to the console. To fix this, you need to implement the actual code to display visual notifications and play audio notifications.

<SUGGESTION> Here are some suggestions to implement the visual and audio notifications:
1. Visual Notifications:
   - You can use a GUI library like Tkinter or PyQt to create a pop-up window or a notification banner that displays the notification message.
   - Alternatively, you can use a system tray notification to display the message.
   - Make sure to show the notifications when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.

2. Audio Notifications:
   - You can use a library like `pygame` or `playsound` to play audio files for the notifications.
   - Create audio files for the different notification messages (e.g., "Break time!", "Long break time!").
   - Play the corresponding audio file when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.

Remember to update the `play_notification` method in the `PomodoroTimer` class with the actual code to display visual notifications and play audio notifications.

Once you have implemented the visual and audio notifications, the code will meet the requirements mentioned in REQ3."

Visual Notifications:\n   - You can use a GUI library like Tkinter or PyQt to create a pop-up window or a notification banner that displays the notification message.\n   - Alternatively, you can use a system tray notification to display the message.\n   - Make sure to show the notifications when a session starts or ends, and when it\'s time for a break.\n\n2. Audio Notifications:\n   - You can use a library like pygame or playsound to play audio files for the notifications.\n   - Create audio files for the different notification messages (e.g., "Break time!", "Long break time!").\n   - Play the corresponding audio file when a session starts or ends, and when it\'s time for a break.\n\nRemember to update the play_notification method in the PomodoroTimer class with the actual code to display visual notifications and play audio notifications.\n\nOnce you have implemented the visual and audio notifications, the code will meet the requirements mentioned in REQ3.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the methods in the `TaskManager` class. Specifically, the `add_task`, `remove_task`, and `get_tasks` methods need to be implemented. Additionally, the code is missing the necessary comments for each method. 

To fix this, you need to add the missing method implementations in the `TaskManager` class and provide the necessary comments for each method. Here's an example of how the `add_task` method could be implemented:

```python
def add_task(self, task):
    """
    Adds a task to the task list.

    Args:
        task (str): The task to be added.

    Returns:
        None
    """
    self.tasks.append(task)
```

You should follow a similar approach for the `remove_task` and `get_tasks` methods.

Once you have implemented the missing methods and added the necessary comments, the code will comply with the regulations and be ready for use.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the methods in the `TaskManager` class. Specifically, the `add_task`, `remove_task`, and `get_tasks` methods need to be implemented. Additionally, the code is missing the necessary comments for each method. 

To fix this, you need to add the missing method implementations in the `TaskManager` class and provide the necessary comments for each method. Here's an example of how the `add_task` method could be implemented:

```python
def add_task(self, task):
    """
    Adds a task to the task list.

    Args:
        task (str): The task to be added.

    Returns:
        None
    """
    self.tasks.append(task)
```

You should follow a similar approach for the `remove_task` and `get_tasks` methods.

Once you have implemented the missing methods and added the necessary comments, the code will comply with the regulations and be ready for use."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

| **task_prompt** | "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time. REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique. REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included. REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break. REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services). REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list. |

Here is a new customer's task: "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).
REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `PomodoroTimer` class is missing the implementation of the `get_remaining_time` method. This method is required to retrieve the remaining time of the current focus session or break. To fix this, you need to add the implementation of the `get_remaining_time` method in the `PomodoroTimer` class.

Here is the revised code for the `pomodoro.py` file:

The highest priority comment is that the `PomodoroTimer` class is missing the implementation of the `get_remaining_time` method. This method is required to retrieve the remaining time of the current focus session or break. To fix this, you need to add the implementation of the `get_remaining_time` method in the `PomodoroTimer` class.

Here is the revised code for the `pomodoro.py` file:

```python
'''

if platform.system() == 'Windows':
    import winsound

class PomodoroTimer:

        self.work_duration = 25 * 60  # 25 minutes in seconds
        self.short_break_duration = 5 * 60  # 5 minutes in seconds
        self.long_break_duration = 15 * 60  # 15 minutes in seconds
        self.remaining_time = self.work_duration
        self.is_running = False
        self.focus_sessions = 0

    def start(self):
        self.is_running = True
        while self.remaining_time > 0:
            if self.is_running:
                self.remaining_time -= 1
            time.sleep(1)
            if self.remaining_time == 0:
                if self.focus_sessions < 3:
                    self.remaining_time = self.short_break_duration
                    self.focus_sessions += 1
                    self.play_notification("Break time!")
                else:
                    self.remaining_time = self.long_break_duration
                    self.focus_sessions = 0
                    self.play_notification("Long break time!")
        self.is_running = False

    def pause(self):
        self.is_running = False

    def stop(self):

```

Once you have made the necessary changes, please let me know, and I will review the code again."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).
REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

To specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly, you can create a requirements.txt file in the following format:

requirements.txt

```
platformdirs==2.2.0
pywebview==3.4
```

In this case, we have added two dependencies:

1. platformdirs==2.2.0: This package provides a cross-platform way to access common directories such as user data, user cache, and user config directories.

2. pywebview==3.4: This package allows you to create a web-based GUI for your application using native WebView components. It can be used to display the visual notifications and create an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.

You can add more dependencies to the requirements.txt file as per your project's requirements.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: To specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly, you can create a requirements.txt file in the following format:
requirements.txt
```
platformdirs==2.2.0
pywebview==3.4
```
In this case, we have added two dependencies:
1. platformdirs==2.2.0: This package provides a cross-platform way to access common directories such as user data, user cache, and user config directories.
2. pywebview==3.4: This package allows you to create a web-based GUI for your application using native WebView components. It can be used to display the visual notifications and create an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.
You can add more dependencies to the requirements.txt file as per your project's requirements. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:
