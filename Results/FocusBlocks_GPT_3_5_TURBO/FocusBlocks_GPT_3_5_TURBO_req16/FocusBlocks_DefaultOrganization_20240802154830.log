We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).
REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.
REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file.
REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.
REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.
REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.
REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session.
REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule.
REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled.
REQ13 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Allow users to set custom durations for focus periods and breaks.
REQ14 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Users can create a list of websites and applications to block during focus sessions.
REQ15 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Option to customize notification sounds and themes of the application.
REQ16 Additional feature requirements: Reporting and analytics: Daily, weekly, and monthly reports showing the user's productivity, such as the number of focus sessions completed, tasks completed, and time spent in focus..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT>
The code provided is missing the necessary import statements for the classes used in the main.py file. Specifically, the following imports are required:

```python
from pomodoro import PomodoroTimer
from task_manager import TaskManager
from blocker import Blocker
```

These imports are necessary to create instances of the PomodoroTimer, TaskManager, and Blocker classes in the main.py file. Without these imports, the code will not work as intended.

To fix this issue, add the above import statements at the beginning of the main.py file.

Additionally, it is recommended to follow PEP 8 style guidelines for code formatting, such as using lowercase letters and underscores for variable and function names, and adding docstrings to classes and methods for better code documentation.

Once these changes are made, the code should be ready for testing and further development.

<SUGGESTION>
Add the following import statements at the beginning of the main.py file:

```python
from pomodoro import PomodoroTimer
from task_manager import TaskManager
from blocker import Blocker
```

Ensure that the code follows PEP 8 style guidelines and includes appropriate docstrings for classes and methods.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code provided is missing the necessary import statements for the classes used in the main.py file. Specifically, the following imports are required:

```python
from pomodoro import PomodoroTimer
from task_manager import TaskManager
from blocker import Blocker
```

These imports are necessary to create instances of the PomodoroTimer, TaskManager, and Blocker classes in the main.py file. Without these imports, the code will not work as intended.

To fix this issue, add the above import statements at the beginning of the main.py file.

Additionally, it is recommended to follow PEP 8 style guidelines for code formatting, such as using lowercase letters and underscores for variable and function names, and adding docstrings to classes and methods for better code documentation.

Once these changes are made, the code should be ready for testing and further development.

<SUGGESTION>
Add the following import statements at the beginning of the main.py file:

```python
from pomodoro import PomodoroTimer
from task_manager import TaskManager
from blocker import Blocker
```

Ensure that the code follows PEP 8 style guidelines and includes appropriate docstrings for classes and methods."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).
REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.
REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file.
REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.
REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.
REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.
REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session.
REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule.
REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled.
REQ13 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Allow users to set custom durations for focus periods and breaks.
REQ14 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Users can create a list of websites and applications to block during focus sessions.
REQ15 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Option to customize notification sounds and themes of the application.
REQ16 Additional feature requirements: Reporting and analytics: Daily, weekly, and monthly reports showing the user's productivity, such as the number of focus sessions completed, tasks completed, and time spent in focus..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **task_prompt** | "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time. REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique. REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included. REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break. REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services). REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list. REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file. REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session. REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status. REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session. REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session. REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule. REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled. REQ13 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Allow users to set custom durations for focus periods and breaks. REQ14 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Users can create a list of websites and applications to block during focus sessions. REQ15 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Option to customize notification sounds and themes of the application. REQ16 Additional feature requirements: Reporting and analytics: Daily, weekly, and monthly reports showing the user's productivity, such as the number of focus sessions completed, tasks completed, and time spent in focus. |

The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.\nREQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.\nREQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).
REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.
REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file.
REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.
REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.
REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.
REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session.
REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule.
REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled.
REQ13 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Allow users to set custom durations for focus periods and breaks.
REQ14 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Users can create a list of websites and applications to block during focus sessions.
REQ15 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Option to customize notification sounds and themes of the application.
REQ16 Additional feature requirements: Reporting and analytics: Daily, weekly, and monthly reports showing the user's productivity, such as the number of focus sessions completed, tasks completed, and time spent in focus..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary imports for the classes used in the main.py file. Specifically, the PomodoroTimer, TaskManager, and Blocker classes need to be imported from their respective files. Additionally, the pygame module needs to be imported for audio notifications. 

To fix this, add the following import statements at the top of the main.py file:

```python
from pomodoro import PomodoroTimer
from task_manager import TaskManager
from blocker import Blocker
import pygame
```

Once the imports are added, the code should be able to use the classes and modules without any issues.

The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.\nREQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.\nREQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.\nREQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it\'s time for a break.\nREQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).\nREQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.\nREQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application\'s executable file.\nREQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.\nREQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.\nREQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.\nREQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session.\nREQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule.\nREQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled.\nREQ13 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Allow users to set custom durations for focus periods and breaks.\nREQ14 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Users can create a list of websites and applications to block during focus sessions.\nREQ15 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Option to customize notification sounds and themes of the application.\nREQ16 Additional feature requirements: Reporting and analytics: Daily, weekly, and monthly reports showing the user\'s productivity, such as the number of focus sessions completed, tasks completed, and time spent in focus.', 'modality': 'web application', 'ideas': '', 'language': ' Python', 'codes': 'task_manager.py\npython\n\'\'\'\nFocusBlocks -

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary imports for the classes used in the main.py file. Specifically, the PomodoroTimer, TaskManager, and Blocker classes need to be imported from their respective files. Additionally, the pygame module needs to be imported for audio notifications. 

To fix this, add the following import statements at the top of the main.py file:

```python
from pomodoro import PomodoroTimer
from task_manager import TaskManager
from blocker import Blocker
import pygame
```

Once the imports are added, the code should be able to use the classes and modules without any issues."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).
REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.
REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file.
REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.
REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.
REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.
REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session.
REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule.
REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled.
REQ13 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Allow users to set custom durations for focus periods and breaks.
REQ14 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Users can create a list of websites and applications to block during focus sessions.
REQ15 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Option to customize notification sounds and themes of the application.
REQ16 Additional feature requirements: Reporting and analytics: Daily, weekly, and monthly reports showing the user's productivity, such as the number of focus sessions completed, tasks completed, and time spent in focus..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **task_prompt** | "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time. REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique. REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included. REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break. REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services). REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list. REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file. REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session. REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status. REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session. REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session. REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule. REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled. REQ13 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Allow users to set custom durations for focus periods and breaks. REQ14 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Users can create a list of websites and applications to block during focus sessions. REQ15 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Option to customize notification sounds and themes of the application. REQ16 Additional feature requirements: Reporting and analytics: Daily, weekly, and monthly reports showing the user's productivity, such as the number of focus sessions completed, tasks completed, and time spent in focus. |

The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.\nREQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.\nREQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.\nREQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it\'s time for a break.\nREQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).\nREQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.\nREQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application\'s executable file.\nREQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.\nREQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.\nREQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.\nREQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session.\nREQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule.\nREQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled.\nREQ13 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Allow users to set custom durations for focus periods and breaks.\nREQ14 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Users can create a list of websites and applications to block during focus sessions.\nREQ15 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Option to customize notification sounds and themes of the application.\nREQ16 Additional feature requirements: Reporting and analytics: Daily, weekly, and monthly reports showing the user\'s productivity, such as the number of focus sessions completed, tasks completed, and time spent in focus.', 'modality': 'web application', 'ideas': '', 'language': ' Python', 'codes': 'task_manager.py\npython\n\'\'\'\nFocusBlocks -

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).
REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.
REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file.
REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.
REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.
REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.
REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session.
REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule.
REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled.
REQ13 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Allow users to set custom durations for focus periods and breaks.
REQ14 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Users can create a list of websites and applications to block during focus sessions.
REQ15 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Option to customize notification sounds and themes of the application.
REQ16 Additional feature requirements: Reporting and analytics: Daily, weekly, and monthly reports showing the user's productivity, such as the number of focus sessions completed, tasks completed, and time spent in focus..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT>
In the main.py file, the functions for adding and removing blocked websites and applications are missing. These functions are required to fulfill the core feature of the distracting website and application blocker. Additionally, the functions for blocking and unblocking websites and applications are present, but they are not being called anywhere in the code. To fix this, you should implement the missing functions and make sure to call the block and unblock functions when needed.

<SUGGESTION>
1. Add the following functions to the main.py file:

```python
def add_blocked_website(website):
    blocker.add_blocked_website(website)

def remove_blocked_website(website):
    blocker.remove_blocked_website(website)

def add_blocked_application(application):
    blocker.add_blocked_application(application)

def remove_blocked_application(application):
    blocker.remove_blocked_application(application)
```

2. Call the `block_websites_and_applications()` function when starting a focus session and call the `unblock_websites_and_applications()` function when stopping a focus session. You can modify the `start_pomodoro()` and `stop_pomodoro()` functions as follows:

```python
def start_pomodoro():
    # Check if any blocked websites or applications are present
    if blocker.is_website_blocked("example.com") or blocker.is_application_blocked("example.exe"):
        print("Blocked websites or applications detected. Timer cannot start.")
        return
    blocker.block_websites_and_applications()
    pomodoro_timer.start()

def stop_pomodoro():
    pomodoro_timer.stop()
    blocker.unblock_websites_and_applications()
```

3. Make sure to call the `add_blocked_website()`, `remove_blocked_website()`, `add_blocked_application()`, and `remove_blocked_application()` functions when needed, based on user input or any other logic in your application.

Once these changes are made, the application will have the necessary functionality to add and remove blocked websites and applications, as well as block and unblock them during focus sessions.

The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.\nREQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.\nREQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.\nREQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it\'s time for a break.\nREQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).\nREQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.\nREQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application\'s executable file.\nREQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.\nREQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.\nREQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.\nREQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session.\nREQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule.\nREQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled.\nREQ13 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Allow users to set custom durations for focus periods and breaks.\nREQ14 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Users can create a list of websites and applications to block during focus sessions.\nREQ15 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Option to customize notification sounds and themes of the application.\nREQ16 Additional feature requirements: Reporting and analytics: Daily, weekly, and monthly reports showing the user\'s productivity, such as the number of focus sessions completed, tasks completed, and time spent in focus.', 'modality': 'web application', 'ideas': '', 'language': ' Python', 'codes': 'task_manager.py\npython\n\'\'\'\nFocusBlocks -

Make sure to call the add_blocked_website(), remove_blocked_website(), add_blocked_application(), and remove_blocked_application() functions when needed, based on user input or any other logic in your application.\n\nOnce these changes are made, the application will have the necessary functionality to add and remove blocked websites and applications, as well as block and unblock them during focus sessions.'} |

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
In the main.py file, the functions for adding and removing blocked websites and applications are missing. These functions are required to fulfill the core feature of the distracting website and application blocker. Additionally, the functions for blocking and unblocking websites and applications are present, but they are not being called anywhere in the code. To fix this, you should implement the missing functions and make sure to call the block and unblock functions when needed.

<SUGGESTION>
1. Add the following functions to the main.py file:

```python
def add_blocked_website(website):
    blocker.add_blocked_website(website)

def remove_blocked_website(website):
    blocker.remove_blocked_website(website)

def add_blocked_application(application):
    blocker.add_blocked_application(application)

def remove_blocked_application(application):
    blocker.remove_blocked_application(application)
```

2. Call the `block_websites_and_applications()` function when starting a focus session and call the `unblock_websites_and_applications()` function when stopping a focus session. You can modify the `start_pomodoro()` and `stop_pomodoro()` functions as follows:

```python
def start_pomodoro():
    # Check if any blocked websites or applications are present
    if blocker.is_website_blocked("example.com") or blocker.is_application_blocked("example.exe"):
        print("Blocked websites or applications detected. Timer cannot start.")
        return
    blocker.block_websites_and_applications()
    pomodoro_timer.start()

def stop_pomodoro():
    pomodoro_timer.stop()
    blocker.unblock_websites_and_applications()
```

3. Make sure to call the `add_blocked_website()`, `remove_blocked_website()`, `add_blocked_application()`, and `remove_blocked_application()` functions when needed, based on user input or any other logic in your application.

Once these changes are made, the application will have the necessary functionality to add and remove blocked websites and applications, as well as block and unblock them during focus sessions."

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).
REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.
REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file.
REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.
REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.
REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.
REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session.
REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule.
REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled.
REQ13 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Allow users to set custom durations for focus periods and breaks.
REQ14 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Users can create a list of websites and applications to block during focus sessions.
REQ15 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Option to customize notification sounds and themes of the application.
REQ16 Additional feature requirements: Reporting and analytics: Daily, weekly, and monthly reports showing the user's productivity, such as the number of focus sessions completed, tasks completed, and time spent in focus..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **task_prompt** | "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time. REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique. REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included. REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break. REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services). REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list. REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file. REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session. REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status. REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session. REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session. REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule. REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled. REQ13 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Allow users to set custom durations for focus periods and breaks. REQ14 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Users can create a list of websites and applications to block during focus sessions. REQ15 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Option to customize notification sounds and themes of the application. REQ16 Additional feature requirements: Reporting and analytics: Daily, weekly, and monthly reports showing the user's productivity, such as the number of focus sessions completed, tasks completed, and time spent in focus. |

You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).
REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.
REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file.
REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.
REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.
REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.
REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session.
REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule.
REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled.
REQ13 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Allow users to set custom durations for focus periods and breaks.
REQ14 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Users can create a list of websites and applications to block during focus sessions.
REQ15 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Option to customize notification sounds and themes of the application.
REQ16 Additional feature requirements: Reporting and analytics: Daily, weekly, and monthly reports showing the user's productivity, such as the number of focus sessions completed, tasks completed, and time spent in focus..

Task: ""FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).
REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.
REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file.
REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.
REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.
REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.
REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session.
REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule.
REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled.
REQ13 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Allow users to set custom durations for focus periods and breaks.
REQ14 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Users can create a list of websites and applications to block during focus sessions.
REQ15 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Option to customize notification sounds and themes of the application.
REQ16 Additional feature requirements: Reporting and analytics: Daily, weekly, and monthly reports showing the user's productivity, such as the number of focus sessions completed, tasks completed, and time spent in focus.".

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation
