I think the product modality that best suits the requirements of "FocusBlocks" is a Website. It will allow users to access the application from any device with a web browser, making it easily accessible and convenient to use. Additionally, a website can provide a user-friendly interface for managing tasks, customizing settings, and displaying reports and analytics.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).
REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.
REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file.
REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.
REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.
REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.
REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session.
REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule.
REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled.
REQ13 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Allow users to set custom durations for focus periods and breaks.
REQ14 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Users can create a list of websites and applications to block during focus sessions.
REQ15 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Option to customize notification sounds and themes of the application.
REQ16 Additional feature requirements: Reporting and analytics: Daily, weekly, and monthly reports showing the user's productivity, such as the number of focus sessions completed, tasks completed, and time spent in focus.
REQ17 Additional feature requirements: Reporting and analytics: Visual analytics in the form of graphs or charts to make it easy to assess productivity trends.
REQ18 Additional feature requirements: Technical requirements: Use of local storage or an embedded database to store user data and preferences.
REQ19 Additional feature requirements: Additional features: Integration with popular calendar applications for task scheduling.
REQ20 Additional feature requirements: Additional features: Social feature to allow users to set and share productivity challenges with friends or colleagues.
REQ21 Accessibility requirements: Keyboard navigation: Full functionality should be accessible via keyboard shortcuts to ensure that users who cannot use a mouse can navigate efficiently through the application.
REQ22 Accessibility requirements: Keyboard navigation: Implement tab navigation through all interactive elements in a logical order.
REQ23 Accessibility requirements: Keyboard navigation: Provide visual indicators for the currently focused element..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).
REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.
REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file.
REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.
REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.
REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.
REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session.
REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule.
REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled.
REQ13 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Allow users to set custom durations for focus periods and breaks.
REQ14 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Users can create a list of websites and applications to block during focus sessions.
REQ15 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Option to customize notification sounds and themes of the application.
REQ16 Additional feature requirements: Reporting and analytics: Daily, weekly, and monthly reports showing the user's productivity, such as the number of focus sessions completed, tasks completed, and time spent in focus.
REQ17 Additional feature requirements: Reporting and analytics: Visual analytics in the form of graphs or charts to make it easy to assess productivity trends.
REQ18 Additional feature requirements: Technical requirements: Use of local storage or an embedded database to store user data and preferences.
REQ19 Additional feature requirements: Additional features: Integration with popular calendar applications for task scheduling.
REQ20 Additional feature requirements: Additional features: Social feature to allow users to set and share productivity challenges with friends or colleagues.
REQ21 Accessibility requirements: Keyboard navigation: Full functionality should be accessible via keyboard shortcuts to ensure that users who cannot use a mouse can navigate efficiently through the application.
REQ22 Accessibility requirements: Keyboard navigation: Implement tab navigation through all interactive elements in a logical order.
REQ23 Accessibility requirements: Keyboard navigation: Provide visual indicators for the currently focused element..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is regarding the missing import statements in the main.py file. The classes PomodoroTimer, TaskManager, and Blocker are used in the main.py file, but they are not imported. To fix this, add the following import statements at the beginning of the main.py file:

```python
from pomodoro import PomodoroTimer
from task_manager import TaskManager
from blocker import Blocker
```

This will ensure that the required classes are imported and can be used in the main.py file.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is regarding the missing import statements in the main.py file. The classes PomodoroTimer, TaskManager, and Blocker are used in the main.py file, but they are not imported. To fix this, add the following import statements at the beginning of the main.py file:

```python
from pomodoro import PomodoroTimer
from task_manager import TaskManager
from blocker import Blocker
```

This will ensure that the required classes are imported and can be used in the main.py file."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).
REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.
REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file.
REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.
REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.
REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.
REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session.
REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule.
REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled.
REQ13 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Allow users to set custom durations for focus periods and breaks.
REQ14 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Users can create a list of websites and applications to block during focus sessions.
REQ15 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Option to customize notification sounds and themes of the application.

| --- | --- |
| **task_prompt** | "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time. REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique. REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included. REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break. REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services). REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list. REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file. REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session. REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status. REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session. REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session. REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule. REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled. REQ13 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Allow users to set custom durations for focus periods and breaks. REQ14 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Users can create a list of websites and applications to block during focus sessions. REQ15 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Option to customize notification sounds and themes of the application. REQ16 Additional feature requirements: Reporting and analytics: Daily, weekly, and monthly reports showing the user's productivity, such as the number of focus sessions completed, tasks completed, and time spent in focus. REQ17 Additional feature requirements: Reporting and analytics: Visual analytics in the form of graphs or charts to make it easy to assess productivity trends. REQ18 Additional feature requirements: Technical requirements: Use of local storage or an embedded database to store user data and preferences. REQ19 Additional feature requirements: Additional features: Integration with popular calendar applications for task scheduling. REQ20 Additional feature requirements: Additional features: Social feature to allow users to set and share productivity challenges with friends or colleagues. REQ21 Accessibility requirements: Keyboard navigation: Full functionality should be accessible via keyboard shortcuts to ensure that users who cannot use a mouse can navigate efficiently through the application. REQ22 Accessibility requirements: Keyboard navigation: Implement tab navigation through all interactive elements in a logical order. REQ23 Accessibility requirements: Keyboard navigation: Provide visual indicators for the currently focused element. |

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the implementation of the audio notification feature in the `PomodoroTimer` class. Currently, the code checks if the `pygame` library is available and initializes the audio player accordingly. However, the code does not provide a way to disable or customize the audio notification feature.

To address this, I suggest adding methods to enable/disable the audio notification and set the notification sound file. Additionally, it would be beneficial to provide a default notification sound file in case the user does not specify a custom sound.

Here's an updated version of the `PomodoroTimer` class with the suggested changes:

 <Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the implementation of the audio notification feature in the `PomodoroTimer` class. Currently, the code checks if the `pygame` library is available and initializes the audio player accordingly. However, the code does not provide a way to disable or customize the audio notification feature.

To address this, I suggest adding methods to enable/disable the audio notification and set the notification sound file. Additionally, it would be beneficial to provide a default notification sound file in case the user does not specify a custom sound.

Here's an updated version of the `PomodoroTimer` class with the suggested changes:

```python
import time
import platform
import threading
import pygame

class PomodoroTimer:
    def __init__(self, audio_notification_sound="notification.wav"):
        self.work_duration = 25 * 60  # 25 minutes in seconds
        self.short_break_duration = 5 * 60  # 5 minutes in seconds
        self.long_break_duration = 15 * 60  # 15 minutes in seconds
        self.remaining_time = self.work_duration
        self.is_running = False
        self.focus_sessions = 0

        else:

            self.focus_sessions += 1
            self.play_notification("Break time!")
        else:
            self.remaining_time = self.long_break_duration
            self.focus_sessions = 0
            self.play_notification("Long break time!")
        self.start()

    def play_notification(self, message):
        print(message)

            try:

                self.audio_player.play()
            except Exception as e:

| **task_prompt** | "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time. REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique. REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included. REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break. REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services). REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list. REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file. REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session. REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status. REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session. REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session. REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule. REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled. REQ13 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Allow users to set custom durations for focus periods and breaks. REQ14 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Users can create a list of websites and applications to block during focus sessions. REQ15 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Option to customize notification sounds and themes of the application.

Currently, the code checks if the pygame library is available and initializes the audio player accordingly. However, the code does not provide a way to disable or customize the audio notification feature.\n\nTo address this, I suggest adding methods to enable/disable the audio notification and set the notification sound file. Additionally, it would be beneficial to provide a default notification sound file in case the user does not specify a custom sound.\n\nHere\'s an updated version of the PomodoroTimer class with the suggested changes:\n\npython\nimport time\nimport platform\nimport threading\nimport pygame\n\nclass PomodoroTimer:\n    def __init__(self, audio_notification_sound="notification.wav"):\n        self.work_duration = 25 * 60  # 25 minutes in seconds\n        self.short_break_duration = 5 * 60  # 5 minutes in seconds\n        self.long_break_duration = 15 * 60  # 15 minutes in seconds\n        self.remaining_time = self.work_duration\n        self.is_running = False\n        self.focus_sessions = 0\n        self.timer = None\n        self.audio_notification_enabled = True\n        self.audio_notification_sound = audio_notification_sound\n        self.audio_player = None\n        self.init_audio_player()\n\n    def init_audio_player(self):\n        try:\n            pygame.mixer.init()\n            self.audio_player = pygame.mixer.music\n        except ModuleNotFoundError:\n            self.audio_player = None\n            print("Audio notification feature is not available.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the implementation of the audio notification feature in the `PomodoroTimer` class. Currently, the code checks if the `pygame` library is available and initializes the audio player accordingly. However, the code does not provide a way to disable or customize the audio notification feature.

To address this, I suggest adding methods to enable/disable the audio notification and set the notification sound file. Additionally, it would be beneficial to provide a default notification sound file in case the user does not specify a custom sound.

Here's an updated version of the `PomodoroTimer` class with the suggested changes:

```python

        self.long_break_duration = 15 * 60  # 15 minutes in seconds
        self.remaining_time = self.work_duration

    def set_notification_sound(self, sound_file):
        self.audio_notification_sound = sound_file

    def start(self):

            return
        self.is_running = True

    def set_short_break_duration(self, duration):
        self.short_break_duration = duration * 60

    def set_long_break_duration(self, duration):
        self.long_break_duration = duration * 60

    def get_remaining_time(self):
        return self.remaining_time

    def _update_remaining_time(self):

```

With these changes, users can enable/disable the audio notification feature and customize the notification sound file if desired."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).
REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.
REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file.
REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.
REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.
REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.
REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session.
REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule.
REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled.
REQ13 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Allow users to set custom durations for focus periods and breaks.
REQ14 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Users can create a list of websites and applications to block during focus sessions.
REQ15 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Option to customize notification sounds and themes of the application.
REQ16 Additional feature requirements: Reporting and analytics: Daily, weekly, and monthly reports showing the user's productivity, such as the number of focus sessions completed, tasks completed, and time spent in focus.
REQ17 Additional feature requirements: Reporting and analytics: Visual analytics in the form of graphs or charts to make it easy to assess productivity trends.
REQ18 Additional feature requirements: Technical requirements: Use of local storage or an embedded database to store user data and preferences.
REQ19 Additional feature requirements: Additional features: Integration with popular calendar applications for task scheduling.
REQ20 Additional feature requirements: Additional features: Social feature to allow users to set and share productivity challenges with friends or colleagues.
REQ21 Accessibility requirements: Keyboard navigation: Full functionality should be accessible via keyboard shortcuts to ensure that users who cannot use a mouse can navigate efficiently through the application.
REQ22 Accessibility requirements: Keyboard navigation: Implement tab navigation through all interactive elements in a logical order.
REQ23 Accessibility requirements: Keyboard navigation: Provide visual indicators for the currently focused element..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code has been modified based on the comments. The `PomodoroTimer` class now includes methods to enable/disable the audio notification feature and set the notification sound file. The `init_audio_player` method initializes the audio player using the `pygame` library if available. The `play_notification` method checks if the audio notification is enabled before playing the notification sound.

Please note that the code provided is a partial implementation and may require additional code to fully satisfy all the requirements and features mentioned in the task.

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **task_prompt** | "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time. REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique. REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included. REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break. REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services). REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list. REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file. REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session. REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status. REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.

| **task_prompt** | "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time. REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique. REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included. REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break. REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services). REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list. REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file. REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session. REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status. REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session. REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session. REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule. REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled. REQ13 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Allow users to set custom durations for focus periods and breaks.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).
REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.
REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file.
REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.
REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.
REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.
REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session.
REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule.
REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled.
REQ13 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Allow users to set custom durations for focus periods and breaks.
REQ14 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Users can create a list of websites and applications to block during focus sessions.
REQ15 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Option to customize notification sounds and themes of the application.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the implementation of the audio notification feature in the `PomodoroTimer` class. Currently, the code uses the `pygame` library for playing audio notifications, but it is not imported in the `main.py` file. To fix this, you need to import the `pygame` library in the `main.py` file.

Instructions for revision:
1. In the `main.py` file, add the following import statement at the top of the file:
   ```python
   import pygame
   ```

Please make the necessary changes and let me know when you are done.

| **task_prompt** | "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time. REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique. REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included. REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break. REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services). REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.

Task: ""FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).
REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.
REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file.
REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.
REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.
REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.
REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session.
REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule.
REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled.
REQ13 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Allow users to set custom durations for focus periods and breaks.
REQ14 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Users can create a list of websites and applications to block during focus sessions.
REQ15 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Option to customize notification sounds and themes of the application.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the implementation of the audio notification feature in the `PomodoroTimer` class. Currently, the code uses the `pygame` library for playing audio notifications, but it is not imported in the `main.py` file. To fix this, you need to import the `pygame` library in the `main.py` file.

Instructions for revision:
1. In the `main.py` file, add the following import statement at the top of the file:
   ```python
   import pygame
   ```

Please make the necessary changes and let me know when you are done."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

| **task_prompt** | "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time. REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique. REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included. REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break. REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services). REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list. REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file. REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session. REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status. REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session. REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session. REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule. REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled. REQ13 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Allow users to set custom durations for focus periods and breaks. REQ14 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Users can create a list of websites and applications to block during focus sessions. REQ15 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Option to customize notification sounds and themes of the application. REQ16 Additional feature requirements: Reporting and analytics: Daily, weekly, and monthly reports showing the user's productivity, such as the number of focus sessions completed, tasks completed, and time spent in focus. REQ17 Additional feature requirements: Reporting and analytics: Visual analytics in the form of graphs or charts to make it easy to assess productivity trends. REQ18 Additional feature requirements: Technical requirements: Use of local storage or an embedded database to store user data and preferences. REQ19 Additional feature requirements: Additional features: Integration with popular calendar applications for task scheduling. REQ20 Additional feature requirements: Additional features: Social feature to allow users to set and share productivity challenges with friends or colleagues. REQ21 Accessibility requirements: Keyboard navigation: Full functionality should be accessible via keyboard shortcuts to ensure that users who cannot use a mouse can navigate efficiently through the application. REQ22 Accessibility requirements: Keyboard navigation: Implement tab navigation through all interactive elements in a logical order. REQ23 Accessibility requirements: Keyboard navigation: Provide visual indicators for the currently focused element. |

| **task_prompt** | "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time. REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique. REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included. REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break. REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services). REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list. REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file. REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session. REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status. REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session. REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session. REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule. REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled. REQ13 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Allow users to set custom durations for focus periods and breaks. REQ14 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Users can create a list of websites and applications to block during focus sessions. REQ15 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Option to customize notification sounds and themes of the application.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).
REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.
REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file.
REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.
REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.
REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.
REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session.
REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule.
REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled.
REQ13 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Allow users to set custom durations for focus periods and breaks.
REQ14 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Users can create a list of websites and applications to block during focus sessions.
REQ15 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Option to customize notification sounds and themes of the application.
REQ16 Additional feature requirements: Reporting and analytics: Daily, weekly, and monthly reports showing the user's productivity, such as the number of focus sessions completed, tasks completed, and time spent in focus.
REQ17 Additional feature requirements: Reporting and analytics: Visual analytics in the form of graphs or charts to make it easy to assess productivity trends.
REQ18 Additional feature requirements: Technical requirements: Use of local storage or an embedded database to store user data and preferences.
REQ19 Additional feature requirements: Additional features: Integration with popular calendar applications for task scheduling.
REQ20 Additional feature requirements: Additional features: Social feature to allow users to set and share productivity challenges with friends or colleagues.
REQ21 Accessibility requirements: Keyboard navigation: Full functionality should be accessible via keyboard shortcuts to ensure that users who cannot use a mouse can navigate efficiently through the application.
REQ22 Accessibility requirements: Keyboard navigation: Implement tab navigation through all interactive elements in a logical order.
REQ23 Accessibility requirements: Keyboard navigation: Provide visual indicators for the currently focused element..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.
REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file.
REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.
REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.
REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.
REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session.
REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule.
REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled.
REQ13 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Allow users to set custom durations for focus periods and breaks.
REQ14 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Users can create a list of websites and applications to block during focus sessions.
REQ15 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Option to customize notification sounds and themes of the application.

You are Counselor. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include asking what user and customer think and provide your valuable suggestions. 
Here is a new customer's task: "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time.
REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique.
REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included.
REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break.
REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services).
REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list.
REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file.
REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session.
REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status.
REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session.
REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session.
REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule.
REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled.
REQ13 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Allow users to set custom durations for focus periods and breaks.

| **task_prompt** | "FocusBlocks" is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique with a twist. The application not only acts as a simple timer but also blocks distracting websites and applications during focus sessions. It includes features for task management, allowing users to allocate specific tasks to each focus session and track their progress over time. REQ1 Core features: Pomodoro timer: The application must allow users to start, pause, and stop a focus session based on the Pomodoro technique. REQ2 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Users should be able to customize the duration of focus sessions and break intervals, with default settings being 25 minutes for focus and 5 minutes for short breaks. An option for longer breaks (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions should also be included. REQ3 Core features: Pomodoro timer: Visual and audio notifications to alert users when a session starts or ends, and when it's time for a break. REQ4 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: During focus sessions, the application must block access to a user-customizable list of websites and applications that are deemed distracting (e.g., social media, streaming services). REQ5 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The app should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding or removing websites and applications from the block list. REQ6 Core features: Distracting website and application blocker: The blocking feature must be robust enough to prevent easy bypasses, such as using a different browser or renaming the application's executable file. REQ7 Core features: Task management: Users must be able to create a list of tasks they plan to work on during each focus session. REQ8 Core features: Task management: Each task should have a title, a brief description, an estimated duration (number of Pomodoros), and a completion status. REQ9 Core features: Task management: The application should allow users to edit task details, mark tasks as complete, and review completed tasks at the end of each day or session. REQ10 Core features: Integration with focus session: Before starting a focus session, users should be prompted to select a task or tasks they intend to work on during that session. REQ11 Core features: Integration with focus session: The application should track the time spent on each task and automatically suggest breaks based on the Pomodoro schedule. REQ12 Core features: Integration with focus session: Optionally, users can skip or end the focus session early, in which case the app should ask if the task was completed or needs to be rescheduled. REQ13 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Allow users to set custom durations for focus periods and breaks. REQ14 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Users can create a list of websites and applications to block during focus sessions. REQ15 Additional feature requirements: Customization: Option to customize notification sounds and themes of the application. REQ16 Additional feature requirements: Reporting and analytics: Daily, weekly, and monthly reports showing the user's productivity, such as the number of focus sessions completed, tasks completed, and time spent in focus. REQ17 Additional feature requirements: Reporting and analytics: Visual analytics in the form of graphs or charts to make it easy to assess productivity trends. REQ18 Additional feature requirements: Technical requirements: Use of local storage or an embedded database to store user data and preferences. REQ19 Additional feature requirements: Additional features: Integration with popular calendar applications for task scheduling. REQ20 Additional feature requirements: Additional features: Social feature to allow users to set and share productivity challenges with friends or colleagues.

Programming Language: "{language}" Ideas: "{ideas}" Codes:  "{codes}" Requirements: "{requirements}" As the {assistant_role}, by using Markdown, you should write a manual.md file which is a detailed user manual to use the software, including introducing main functions of the software, how to install environment dependencies and how to use/play it. For example: manual.md ``` LangChain Building applications with LLMs through composability Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js. Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel. Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
