We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the `start_game()` method in the `SelectDifficulty` class. This method is responsible for creating an instance of the `Game` class and starting the game. To fix this, you need to add the `start_game()` method to the `SelectDifficulty` class and instantiate the `Game` class with the selected difficulty level. Here's the revised code for the `SelectDifficulty` class:

```python
class SelectDifficulty(tk.Toplevel):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.title("Select Difficulty")
        self.geometry("400x300")
        instruction_label = tk.Label(self, text="Select Difficulty", font=("Arial", 24))

[2024-02-08 15:20:03 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 <COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the `start_game()` method in the `SelectDifficulty` class. This method is responsible for creating an instance of the `Game` class and starting the game. To fix this, you need to add the `start_game()` method to the `SelectDifficulty` class and instantiate the `Game` class with the selected difficulty level. Here's the revised code for the `SelectDifficulty` class:

```python
class SelectDifficulty(tk.Toplevel):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.title("Select Difficulty")
        self.geometry("400x300")
        instruction_label = tk.Label(self, text="Select Difficulty", font=("Arial", 24))
        instruction_label.pack(pady=50)
        easy_button = tk.Button(self, text="Easy", command=self.start_game_easy)
        easy_button.pack(pady=20)
        medium_button = tk.Button(self, text="Medium", command=self.start_game_medium)
        medium_button.pack(pady=20)
        hard_button = tk.Button(self, text="Hard", command=self.start_game_hard)
        hard_button.pack(pady=20)

    def start_game(self):
        self.destroy()
        game = Game(difficulty=self.difficulty)
        game.start()

    def start_game_easy(self):
        self.difficulty = "easy"
        self.start_game()

    def start_game_medium(self):
        self.difficulty = "medium"
        self.start_game()

    def start_game_hard(self):
        self.difficulty = "hard"
        self.start_game()
```

Please make the necessary changes to the code and ensure that the `start_game()` method is implemented correctly.

Here\'s the revised code for the SelectDifficulty class:\n\npython\nclass SelectDifficulty(tk.Toplevel):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.title("Select Difficulty")\n        self.geometry("400x300")\n        instruction_label = tk.Label(self, text="Select Difficulty", font=("Arial", 24))\n        instruction_label.pack(pady=50)\n        easy_button = tk.Button(self, text="Easy", command=self.start_game_easy)\n        easy_button.pack(pady=20)\n        medium_button = tk.Button(self, text="Medium", command=self.start_game_medium)\n        medium_button.pack(pady=20)\n        hard_button = tk.Button(self, text="Hard", command=self.start_game_hard)\n        hard_button.pack(pady=20)\n\n    def start_game(self):\n        self.destroy()\n        game = Game(difficulty=self.difficulty)\n        game.start()\n\n    def start_game_easy(self):\n        self.difficulty = "easy"\n        self.start_game()\n\n    def start_game_medium(self):\n        self.difficulty = "medium"\n        self.start_game()\n\n    def start_game_hard(self):\n        self.difficulty = "hard"\n        self.start_game()\n\n\nPlease make the necessary changes to the code and ensure that the start_game() method is implemented correctly.'} |

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the `start_game()` method in the `SelectDifficulty` class. This method is responsible for creating an instance of the `Game` class and starting the game. To fix this, you need to add the `start_game()` method to the `SelectDifficulty` class and instantiate the `Game` class with the selected difficulty level. Here's the revised code for the `SelectDifficulty` class:

```python
class SelectDifficulty(tk.Toplevel):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.title("Select Difficulty")
        self.geometry("400x300")
        instruction_label = tk.Label(self, text="Select Difficulty", font=("Arial", 24))
        instruction_label.pack(pady=50)
        easy_button = tk.Button(self, text="Easy", command=self.start_game_easy)
        easy_button.pack(pady=20)
        medium_button = tk.Button(self, text="Medium", command=self.start_game_medium)
        medium_button.pack(pady=20)
        hard_button = tk.Button(self, text="Hard", command=self.start_game_hard)
        hard_button.pack(pady=20)

    def start_game(self):
        self.destroy()
        game = Game(difficulty=self.difficulty)
        game.start()

    def start_game_easy(self):
        self.difficulty = "easy"
        self.start_game()

    def start_game_medium(self):
        self.difficulty = "medium"
        self.start_game()

    def start_game_hard(self):
        self.difficulty = "hard"
        self.start_game()
```

Please make the necessary changes to the code and ensure that the `start_game()` method is implemented correctly."

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a simple yet engaging Memory Match game that can be played on the desktop. The game will present the player with a grid of cards, face down. Each card has a matching counterpart somewhere in the grid. The objective of the game is for the player to find all the matching pairs by remembering the locations of cards they have previously turned over. This game can be enhanced with different themes, difficulty levels, and maybe even a timer to challenge the player further.
REQ1 Main menu window: Title: Display the game title prominently at the top.
REQ2 Main menu window: Play button: A button to start the game. Clicking this button takes the player to the "Select Difficulty" window.
REQ3 Main menu window: High scores button: Opens a window displaying the high scores from previous games, including the player's name, score, and time.
REQ4 Main menu window: Settings button: Leads to a settings window where players can adjust sound preferences, choose themes, and view game instructions.

<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the `start_game()` method in the `SelectDifficulty` class. This method is responsible for creating an instance of the `Game` class and starting the game. To fix this, you need to add the `start_game()` method to the `SelectDifficulty` class and instantiate the `Game` class with the selected difficulty level. Here's the revised code:

```python
class SelectDifficulty(tk.Toplevel):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.title("Select Difficulty")
        self.geometry("400x300")
        instruction_label = tk.Label(self, text="Select Difficulty", font=("Arial", 24))
        instruction_label.pack(pady=50)
        easy_button = tk.Button(self, text="Easy", command=self.start_game_easy)
        easy_button.pack(pady=20)
        medium_button = tk.Button(self, text="Medium", command=self.start_game_medium)
        medium_button.pack(pady=20)
        hard_button = tk.Button(self, text="Hard", command=self.start_game_hard)
        hard_button.pack(pady=20)

    def start_game(self):

        game = Game(difficulty=self.difficulty)
        game.start()

    def start_game_medium(self):
        self.difficulty = "medium"
        self.start_game()

    def start_game_hard(self):
        self.difficulty = "hard"
        self.start_game()
```

Please make the necessary changes and ensure that the `start_game()` method is implemented correctly.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the `start_game()` method in the `SelectDifficulty` class. This method is responsible for creating an instance of the `Game` class and starting the game. To fix this, you need to add the `start_game()` method to the `SelectDifficulty` class and instantiate the `Game` class with the selected difficulty level. Here's the revised code:

```python
class SelectDifficulty(tk.Toplevel):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.title("Select Difficulty")
        self.geometry("400x300")
        instruction_label = tk.Label(self, text="Select Difficulty", font=("Arial", 24))
        instruction_label.pack(pady=50)
        easy_button = tk.Button(self, text="Easy", command=self.start_game_easy)
        easy_button.pack(pady=20)
        medium_button = tk.Button(self, text="Medium", command=self.start_game_medium)

Here is a new customer's task: Develop a simple yet engaging Memory Match game that can be played on the desktop. The game will present the player with a grid of cards, face down. Each card has a matching counterpart somewhere in the grid. The objective of the game is for the player to find all the matching pairs by remembering the locations of cards they have previously turned over. This game can be enhanced with different themes, difficulty levels, and maybe even a timer to challenge the player further.

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the `start_game()` method in the `SelectDifficulty` class. This method is responsible for creating an instance of the `Game` class and starting the game. To fix this, you need to add the `start_game()` method to the `SelectDifficulty` class and instantiate the `Game` class with the selected difficulty level. Here's an example of how to implement it:

```python
class SelectDifficulty(tk.Toplevel):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.title("Select Difficulty")
        self.geometry("400x300")
        instruction_label = tk.Label(self, text="Select Difficulty", font=("Arial", 24))
        instruction_label.pack(pady=50)
        easy_button = tk.Button(self, text="Easy", command=self.start_game_easy)
        easy_button.pack(pady=20)
        medium_button = tk.Button(self, text="Medium", command=self.start_game_medium)
        medium_button.pack(pady=20)
        hard_button = tk.Button(self, text="Hard", command=self.start_game_hard)
        hard_button.pack(pady=20)

    def start_game(self):
        self.destroy()
        game = Game(difficulty=self.difficulty)
        game.start()

    def start_game_easy(self):
        self.difficulty = "easy"
        self.start_game()

    def start_game_medium(self):
        self.difficulty = "medium"
        self.start_game()

    def start_game_hard(self):
        self.difficulty = "hard"
        self.start_game()
```

With this implementation, when the user selects a difficulty level and clicks the corresponding button, the `start_game()` method will be called, creating an instance of the `Game` class with the selected difficulty and starting the game.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the `start_game()` method in the `SelectDifficulty` class. This method is responsible for creating an instance of the `Game` class and starting the game. To fix this, you need to add the `start_game()` method to the `SelectDifficulty` class and instantiate the `Game` class with the selected difficulty level. Here's an example of how to implement it:

```python
class SelectDifficulty(tk.Toplevel):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.title("Select Difficulty")
        self.geometry("400x300")
        instruction_label = tk.Label(self, text="Select Difficulty", font=("Arial", 24))
        instruction_label.pack(pady=50)
        easy_button = tk.Button(self, text="Easy", command=self.start_game_easy)
        easy_button.pack(pady=20)
        medium_button = tk.Button(self, text="Medium", command=self.start_game_medium)
        medium_button.pack(pady=20)
        hard_button = tk.Button(self, text="Hard", command=self.start_game_hard)
        hard_button.pack(pady=20)

    def start_game(self):
        self.destroy()
        game = Game(difficulty=self.difficulty)
        game.start()

    def start_game_easy(self):
        self.difficulty = "easy"
        self.start_game()

    def start_game_medium(self):
        self.difficulty = "medium"
        self.start_game()

    def start_game_hard(self):
        self.difficulty = "hard"
        self.start_game()
```

With this implementation, when the user selects a difficulty level and clicks the corresponding button, the `start_game()` method will be called, creating an instance of the `Game` class with the selected difficulty and starting the game."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a simple yet engaging Memory Match game that can be played on the desktop. The game will present the player with a grid of cards, face down. Each card has a matching counterpart somewhere in the grid. The objective of the game is for the player to find all the matching pairs by remembering the locations of cards they have previously turned over. This game can be enhanced with different themes, difficulty levels, and maybe even a timer to challenge the player further.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)
