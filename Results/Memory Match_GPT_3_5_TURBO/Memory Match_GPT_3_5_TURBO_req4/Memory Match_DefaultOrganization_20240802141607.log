<COMMENT> The `flip_face_down` method in the `Game` class is missing the `self.root.after` function call, which is used to delay the flipping of the cards. This will cause the cards to flip back immediately without any delay. To fix this, add the `self.root.after` function call before calling the `self.flip_cards_face_down` method.

Here's the revised code for the `flip_face_down` method:

```python
def flip_face_down(self, cards):
    # Flip face-up cards face down after a short delay
    self.root.after(1000, self.flip_cards_face_down, cards)
```

Please make this change in the `game.py` file.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The `flip_face_down` method in the `Game` class is missing the `self.root.after` function call, which is used to delay the flipping of the cards. This will cause the cards to flip back immediately without any delay. To fix this, add the `self.root.after` function call before calling the `self.flip_cards_face_down` method.

Here's the revised code for the `flip_face_down` method:

```python
def flip_face_down(self, cards):
    # Flip face-up cards face down after a short delay
    self.root.after(1000, self.flip_cards_face_down, cards)
```

Please make this change in the `game.py` file."

Here is a new customer's task: Develop a simple yet engaging Memory Match game that can be played on the desktop. The game will present the player with a grid of cards, face down. Each card has a matching counterpart somewhere in the grid. The objective of the game is for the player to find all the matching pairs by remembering the locations of cards they have previously turned over. This game can be enhanced with different themes, difficulty levels, and maybe even a timer to challenge the player further.
REQ1 Main menu window: Title: Display the game title prominently at the top.
REQ2 Main menu window: Play button: A button to start the game. Clicking this button takes the player to the "Select Difficulty" window.
REQ3 Main menu window: High scores button: Opens a window displaying the high scores from previous games, including the player's name, score, and time.
REQ4 Main menu window: Settings button: Leads to a settings window where players can adjust sound preferences, choose themes, and view game instructions..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `flip_face_down` method in the `Game` class is missing the implementation of flipping the cards face down after a short delay. Currently, the method is empty and does not perform any action. To fix this, you need to add the code to flip the specified cards face down after a delay of 1000 milliseconds. You can use the `after` method of the `root` window to schedule the flipping of the cards. Here's the revised code for the `flip_face_down` method:

```python
def flip_face_down(self, cards):
    # Flip face-up cards face down after a short delay
    self.root.after(1000, self.flip_cards_face_down, cards)
```

Please add this code to the `Game` class in the `game.py` file.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `flip_face_down` method in the `Game` class is missing the implementation of flipping the cards face down after a short delay. Currently, the method is empty and does not perform any action. To fix this, you need to add the code to flip the specified cards face down after a delay of 1000 milliseconds. You can use the `after` method of the `root` window to schedule the flipping of the cards. Here's the revised code for the `flip_face_down` method:

```python
def flip_face_down(self, cards):
    # Flip face-up cards face down after a short delay
    self.root.after(1000, self.flip_cards_face_down, cards)
```

Please add this code to the `Game` class in the `game.py` file."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Here is a new customer's task: Develop a simple yet engaging Memory Match game that can be played on the desktop. The game will present the player with a grid of cards, face down. Each card has a matching counterpart somewhere in the grid. The objective of the game is for the player to find all the matching pairs by remembering the locations of cards they have previously turned over. This game can be enhanced with different themes, difficulty levels, and maybe even a timer to challenge the player further.
REQ1 Main menu window: Title: Display the game title prominently at the top.
REQ2 Main menu window: Play button: A button to start the game. Clicking this button takes the player to the "Select Difficulty" window.
REQ3 Main menu window: High scores button: Opens a window displaying the high scores from previous games, including the player's name, score, and time.
REQ4 Main menu window: Settings button: Leads to a settings window where players can adjust sound preferences, choose themes, and view game instructions..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT> The `flip_face_down` method in the `Game` class is missing an important line of code that flips the cards face down after a short delay. To fix this, add the line `self.root.after(1000, self.flip_cards_face_down, cards)` inside the `flip_face_down` method.

Here's the revised code for the `flip_face_down` method:

```python
def flip_face_down(self, cards):
    # Flip face-up cards face down after a short delay
    self.root.after(1000, self.flip_cards_face_down, cards)
```

This will ensure that the face-up cards are flipped face down after a delay of 1000 milliseconds (1 second).

Please make this change and retest the game to ensure that the cards are flipped face down correctly.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The `flip_face_down` method in the `Game` class is missing an important line of code that flips the cards face down after a short delay. To fix this, add the line `self.root.after(1000, self.flip_cards_face_down, cards)` inside the `flip_face_down` method.

Here's the revised code for the `flip_face_down` method:

```python
def flip_face_down(self, cards):
    # Flip face-up cards face down after a short delay
    self.root.after(1000, self.flip_cards_face_down, cards)
```

This will ensure that the face-up cards are flipped face down after a delay of 1000 milliseconds (1 second).

Please make this change and retest the game to ensure that the cards are flipped face down correctly."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a simple yet engaging Memory Match game that can be played on the desktop. The game will present the player with a grid of cards, face down. Each card has a matching counterpart somewhere in the grid. The objective of the game is for the player to find all the matching pairs by remembering the locations of cards they have previously turned over. This game can be enhanced with different themes, difficulty levels, and maybe even a timer to challenge the player further.
REQ1 Main menu window: Title: Display the game title prominently at the top.
REQ2 Main menu window: Play button: A button to start the game. Clicking this button takes the player to the "Select Difficulty" window.
REQ3 Main menu window: High scores button: Opens a window displaying the high scores from previous games, including the player's name, score, and time.
REQ4 Main menu window: Settings button: Leads to a settings window where players can adjust sound preferences, choose themes, and view game instructions..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly, you can create a `requirements.txt` file in the following format:

```
tkinter==8.6
```

In this case, the only dependency required is the `tkinter` package, which is used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) in the game. The version specified is `8.6`, but you can adjust it based on the version of `tkinter` that is compatible with your Python environment.

Save the above content in a file named `requirements.txt` and include it in your project directory.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: To specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly, you can create a `requirements.txt` file in the following format:
```
tkinter==8.6
```
In this case, the only dependency required is the `tkinter` package, which is used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) in the game. The version specified is `8.6`, but you can adjust it based on the version of `tkinter` that is compatible with your Python environment.
Save the above content in a file named `requirements.txt` and include it in your project directory. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

You are Counselor. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include asking what user and customer think and provide your valuable suggestions. 
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a simple yet engaging Memory Match game that can be played on the desktop. The game will present the player with a grid of cards, face down. Each card has a matching counterpart somewhere in the grid. The objective of the game is for the player to find all the matching pairs by remembering the locations of cards they have previously turned over. This game can be enhanced with different themes, difficulty levels, and maybe even a timer to challenge the player further.

REQ3 Main menu window: High scores button: Opens a window displaying the high scores from previous games, including the player's name, score, and time.
REQ4 Main menu window: Settings button: Leads to a settings window where players can adjust sound preferences, choose themes, and view game instructions..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha
