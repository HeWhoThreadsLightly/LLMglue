Here is a new customer's task: Develop a simple yet engaging Memory Match game that can be played on the desktop. The game will present the player with a grid of cards, face down. Each card has a matching counterpart somewhere in the grid. The objective of the game is for the player to find all the matching pairs by remembering the locations of cards they have previously turned over. This game can be enhanced with different themes, difficulty levels, and maybe even a timer to challenge the player further.

REQ28 Additional feature requirements: Difficulty levels: Provide at least three levels of difficulty (e.g., Easy: 4x4 grid, Medium: 6x6 grid, Hard: 8x8 grid)..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the `start_game` method in the `SelectDifficulty` class. This method is responsible for creating an instance of the `Game` class and starting the game. 

To fix this, you need to add the `start_game` method in the `SelectDifficulty` class. Here's an example of how it can be implemented:

```python
def start_game(self):
    self.destroy()
    game = Game(difficulty=self.difficulty)
    game.start()
```

This method should be added after the `start_game_hard` method in the `SelectDifficulty` class.

Once you have made this change, the game should be able to start properly when a difficulty level is selected.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the `start_game` method in the `SelectDifficulty` class. This method is responsible for creating an instance of the `Game` class and starting the game. 

To fix this, you need to add the `start_game` method in the `SelectDifficulty` class. Here's an example of how it can be implemented:

```python
def start_game(self):
    self.destroy()
    game = Game(difficulty=self.difficulty)
    game.start()
```

This method should be added after the `start_game_hard` method in the `SelectDifficulty` class.

Once you have made this change, the game should be able to start properly when a difficulty level is selected."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Here is a new customer's task: Develop a simple yet engaging Memory Match game that can be played on the desktop. The game will present the player with a grid of cards, face down. Each card has a matching counterpart somewhere in the grid. The objective of the game is for the player to find all the matching pairs by remembering the locations of cards they have previously turned over. This game can be enhanced with different themes, difficulty levels, and maybe even a timer to challenge the player further.
REQ1 Main menu window: Title: Display the game title prominently at the top.
REQ2 Main menu window: Play button: A button to start the game. Clicking this button takes the player to the "Select Difficulty" window.
REQ3 Main menu window: High scores button: Opens a window displaying the high scores from previous games, including the player's name, score, and time.
REQ4 Main menu window: Settings button: Leads to a settings window where players can adjust sound preferences, choose themes, and view game instructions.
REQ5 Main menu window: Exit button: A button to exit the game.
REQ6 Select difficulty window: Instruction text: A brief instruction on how to select the difficulty level.
REQ7 Select difficulty window: Difficulty level buttons: Buttons for each difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard). Clicking on one sets the game's difficulty and starts the game.
REQ8 Select difficulty window: Back button: Returns to the Main Menu.
REQ9 Game window: Game grid: The central area where the cards are displayed according to the chosen difficulty level. Cards should be arranged in a grid layout that changes size based on the difficulty.
REQ10 Game window: Score panel: A panel displaying the current number of attempts, number of matches found, and the elapsed time.
REQ11 Game Window: Pause/Menu Button: Pauses the game and opens a small menu with options to resume, restart, change difficulty, or return to the Main Menu.
REQ12 Settings window: Sound settings: Toggle switches for game sound effects and background music.
REQ13 Settings window: Theme selection: Dropdown menu or buttons to select the card and background theme.
REQ14 Settings window: Instructions: A section that outlines the game rules and controls.
REQ15 Settings window: Back button: Saves any changes and returns to the Main Menu.
REQ16 High scores window: Scores display: A list or table displaying the top scores, including details such as player name, score (based on attempts and time), and difficulty level.
REQ17 High scores window: Clear scores button: An option to clear the high score history.
REQ18 High scores window: Back button: Returns to the Main Menu.
REQ19 Game Over/Win Window: Message: Displays a congratulatory message for completing the game and shows the final score and time.
REQ20 Game Over/Win Window: Play Again Button: Restarts the game at the same difficulty level.
REQ21 Game Over/Win Window: Change Difficulty Button: Returns the player to the "Select Difficulty" window to choose a new difficulty level.
REQ22 Game Over/Win Window: Main Menu Button: Returns to the Main Menu.
REQ23 Additional feature requirements: Game logic: Ability to shuffle and randomly place the cards at the start of each game.
REQ24 Additional feature requirements: Game logic: Mechanism to flip cards and reveal their faces when clicked.
REQ25 Additional feature requirements: Game logic: Check for matches when two cards are flipped; if they match, leave them face up, otherwise flip them back.
REQ26 Additional feature requirements: Game logic: Keep track of the number of attempts made and matches found.
REQ27 Additional feature requirements: Game logic: Implement a win condition when all matches are found.
REQ28 Additional feature requirements: Difficulty levels: Provide at least three levels of difficulty (e.g., Easy: 4x4 grid, Medium: 6x6 grid, Hard: 8x8 grid)..

<COMMENT>
In the `Game` class, the `flip_card` method currently checks if the selected card is already face up or already in the face up cards list, and returns without taking any action. However, this logic does not prevent the player from selecting the same card twice and counting it as a match. To fix this, you should add a check to ensure that the selected card is not already in the `face_up_cards` list before flipping it and adding it to the list.

Here's the revised code for the `flip_card` method:

```python
def flip_card(self, card):
    # Check if the card is already face up
    if card.is_face_up:
        return
    # Check if the card is already in the face up cards list
    if card in self.face_up_cards:
        return
    # Flip the selected card
    card.flip()
    self.face_up_cards.append(card)
    # Check for matching pairs
    if len(self.face_up_cards) == 2:
        if self.face_up_cards[0].value == self.face_up_cards[1].value:
            self.remove_cards(self.face_up_cards)
        else:
            self.flip_face_down(self.face_up_cards)
            self.face_up_cards = []
```

Please make this change in the `Game` class and ensure that the logic is working as expected.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
In the `Game` class, the `flip_card` method currently checks if the selected card is already face up or already in the face up cards list, and returns without taking any action. However, this logic does not prevent the player from selecting the same card twice and counting it as a match. To fix this, you should add a check to ensure that the selected card is not already in the `face_up_cards` list before flipping it and adding it to the list.

Here's the revised code for the `flip_card` method:

```python
def flip_card(self, card):
    # Check if the card is already face up
    if card.is_face_up:
        return
    # Check if the card is already in the face up cards list
    if card in self.face_up_cards:
        return
    # Flip the selected card
    card.flip()
    self.face_up_cards.append(card)
    # Check for matching pairs
    if len(self.face_up_cards) == 2:
        if self.face_up_cards[0].value == self.face_up_cards[1].value:
            self.remove_cards(self.face_up_cards)
        else:
            self.flip_face_down(self.face_up_cards)
            self.face_up_cards = []
```

Please make this change in the `Game` class and ensure that the logic is working as expected."

| **task_prompt** | Develop a simple yet engaging Memory Match game that can be played on the desktop. The game will present the player with a grid of cards, face down. Each card has a matching counterpart somewhere in the grid. The objective of the game is for the player to find all the matching pairs by remembering the locations of cards they have previously turned over. This game can be enhanced with different themes, difficulty levels, and maybe even a timer to challenge the player further. REQ1 Main menu window: Title: Display the game title prominently at the top. REQ2 Main menu window: Play button: A button to start the game. Clicking this button takes the player to the "Select Difficulty" window. REQ3 Main menu window: High scores button: Opens a window displaying the high scores from previous games, including the player's name, score, and time. REQ4 Main menu window: Settings button: Leads to a settings window where players can adjust sound preferences, choose themes, and view game instructions. REQ5 Main menu window: Exit button: A button to exit the game. REQ6 Select difficulty window: Instruction text: A brief instruction on how to select the difficulty level. REQ7 Select difficulty window: Difficulty level buttons: Buttons for each difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard). Clicking on one sets the game's difficulty and starts the game. REQ8 Select difficulty window: Back button: Returns to the Main Menu. REQ9 Game window: Game grid: The central area where the cards are displayed according to the chosen difficulty level. Cards should be arranged in a grid layout that changes size based on the difficulty. REQ10 Game window: Score panel: A panel displaying the current number of attempts, number of matches found, and the elapsed time. REQ11 Game Window: Pause/Menu Button: Pauses the game and opens a small menu with options to resume, restart, change difficulty, or return to the Main Menu. REQ12 Settings window: Sound settings: Toggle switches for game sound effects and background music. REQ13 Settings window: Theme selection: Dropdown menu or buttons to select the card and background theme. REQ14 Settings window: Instructions: A section that outlines the game rules and controls. REQ15 Settings window: Back button: Saves any changes and returns to the Main Menu. REQ16 High scores window: Scores display: A list or table displaying the top scores, including details such as player name, score (based on attempts and time), and difficulty level. REQ17 High scores window: Clear scores button: An option to clear the high score history. REQ18 High scores window: Back button: Returns to the Main Menu. REQ19 Game Over/Win Window: Message: Displays a congratulatory message for completing the game and shows the final score and time. REQ20 Game Over/Win Window: Play Again Button: Restarts the game at the same difficulty level. REQ21 Game Over/Win Window: Change Difficulty Button: Returns the player to the "Select Difficulty" window to choose a new difficulty level. REQ22 Game Over/Win Window: Main Menu Button: Returns to the Main Menu. REQ23 Additional feature requirements: Game logic: Ability to shuffle and randomly place the cards at the start of each game. REQ24 Additional feature requirements: Game logic: Mechanism to flip cards and reveal their faces when clicked. REQ25 Additional feature requirements: Game logic: Check for matches when two cards are flipped; if they match, leave them face up, otherwise flip them back. REQ26 Additional feature requirements: Game logic: Keep track of the number of attempts made and matches found. REQ27 Additional feature requirements: Game logic: Implement a win condition when all matches are found. REQ28 Additional feature requirements: Difficulty levels: Provide at least three levels of difficulty (e.g., Easy: 4x4 grid, Medium: 6x6 grid, Hard: 8x8 grid). |

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a simple yet engaging Memory Match game that can be played on the desktop. The game will present the player with a grid of cards, face down. Each card has a matching counterpart somewhere in the grid. The objective of the game is for the player to find all the matching pairs by remembering the locations of cards they have previously turned over. This game can be enhanced with different themes, difficulty levels, and maybe even a timer to challenge the player further.
REQ1 Main menu window: Title: Display the game title prominently at the top.
REQ2 Main menu window: Play button: A button to start the game. Clicking this button takes the player to the "Select Difficulty" window.
REQ3 Main menu window: High scores button: Opens a window displaying the high scores from previous games, including the player's name, score, and time.
REQ4 Main menu window: Settings button: Leads to a settings window where players can adjust sound preferences, choose themes, and view game instructions.
REQ5 Main menu window: Exit button: A button to exit the game.
REQ6 Select difficulty window: Instruction text: A brief instruction on how to select the difficulty level.

REQ8 Select difficulty window: Back button: Returns to the Main Menu.
REQ9 Game window: Game grid: The central area where the cards are displayed according to the chosen difficulty level. Cards should be arranged in a grid layout that changes size based on the difficulty.
REQ10 Game window: Score panel: A panel displaying the current number of attempts, number of matches found, and the elapsed time.
REQ11 Game Window: Pause/Menu Button: Pauses the game and opens a small menu with options to resume, restart, change difficulty, or return to the Main Menu.
REQ12 Settings window: Sound settings: Toggle switches for game sound effects and background music.
REQ13 Settings window: Theme selection: Dropdown menu or buttons to select the card and background theme.
REQ14 Settings window: Instructions: A section that outlines the game rules and controls.
REQ15 Settings window: Back button: Saves any changes and returns to the Main Menu.
REQ16 High scores window: Scores display: A list or table displaying the top scores, including details such as player name, score (based on attempts and time), and difficulty level.
REQ17 High scores window: Clear scores button: An option to clear the high score history.
REQ18 High scores window: Back button: Returns to the Main Menu.
REQ19 Game Over/Win Window: Message: Displays a congratulatory message for completing the game and shows the final score and time.

REQ21 Game Over/Win Window: Change Difficulty Button: Returns the player to the "Select Difficulty" window to choose a new difficulty level.
REQ22 Game Over/Win Window: Main Menu Button: Returns to the Main Menu.
REQ23 Additional feature requirements: Game logic: Ability to shuffle and randomly place the cards at the start of each game.
REQ24 Additional feature requirements: Game logic: Mechanism to flip cards and reveal their faces when clicked.
REQ25 Additional feature requirements: Game logic: Check for matches when two cards are flipped; if they match, leave them face up, otherwise flip them back.
REQ26 Additional feature requirements: Game logic: Keep track of the number of attempts made and matches found.
REQ27 Additional feature requirements: Game logic: Implement a win condition when all matches are found.
REQ28 Additional feature requirements: Difficulty levels: Provide at least three levels of difficulty (e.g., Easy: 4x4 grid, Medium: 6x6 grid, Hard: 8x8 grid)..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the `start_game()` method in the `SelectDifficulty` class. This method is responsible for creating an instance of the `Game` class and starting the game. 

To fix this, you need to add the `start_game()` method to the `SelectDifficulty` class. Here's an example of how it can be implemented:

```python
def start_game(self):
    self.destroy()
    game = Game(difficulty=self.difficulty)
    game.start()
```

Once you've added this method, the game should start correctly when a difficulty level button is clicked in the `SelectDifficulty` window.

Please make this revision to ensure the game can be played after selecting a difficulty level.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the `start_game()` method in the `SelectDifficulty` class. This method is responsible for creating an instance of the `Game` class and starting the game. 

To fix this, you need to add the `start_game()` method to the `SelectDifficulty` class. Here's an example of how it can be implemented:

```python
def start_game(self):
    self.destroy()
    game = Game(difficulty=self.difficulty)
    game.start()
```

Once you've added this method, the game should start correctly when a difficulty level button is clicked in the `SelectDifficulty` window.

Please make this revision to ensure the game can be played after selecting a difficulty level."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a simple yet engaging Memory Match game that can be played on the desktop. The game will present the player with a grid of cards, face down. Each card has a matching counterpart somewhere in the grid. The objective of the game is for the player to find all the matching pairs by remembering the locations of cards they have previously turned over. This game can be enhanced with different themes, difficulty levels, and maybe even a timer to challenge the player further.
REQ1 Main menu window: Title: Display the game title prominently at the top.
REQ2 Main menu window: Play button: A button to start the game. Clicking this button takes the player to the "Select Difficulty" window.
REQ3 Main menu window: High scores button: Opens a window displaying the high scores from previous games, including the player's name, score, and time.
REQ4 Main menu window: Settings button: Leads to a settings window where players can adjust sound preferences, choose themes, and view game instructions.
REQ5 Main menu window: Exit button: A button to exit the game.
REQ6 Select difficulty window: Instruction text: A brief instruction on how to select the difficulty level.
REQ7 Select difficulty window: Difficulty level buttons: Buttons for each difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard). Clicking on one sets the game's difficulty and starts the game.
REQ8 Select difficulty window: Back button: Returns to the Main Menu.
REQ9 Game window: Game grid: The central area where the cards are displayed according to the chosen difficulty level. Cards should be arranged in a grid layout that changes size based on the difficulty.
REQ10 Game window: Score panel: A panel displaying the current number of attempts, number of matches found, and the elapsed time.
REQ11 Game Window: Pause/Menu Button: Pauses the game and opens a small menu with options to resume, restart, change difficulty, or return to the Main Menu.
REQ12 Settings window: Sound settings: Toggle switches for game sound effects and background music.
REQ13 Settings window: Theme selection: Dropdown menu or buttons to select the card and background theme.
REQ14 Settings window: Instructions: A section that outlines the game rules and controls.
REQ15 Settings window: Back button: Saves any changes and returns to the Main Menu.
REQ16 High scores window: Scores display: A list or table displaying the top scores, including details such as player name, score (based on attempts and time), and difficulty level.
REQ17 High scores window: Clear scores button: An option to clear the high score history.
REQ18 High scores window: Back button: Returns to the Main Menu.
REQ19 Game Over/Win Window: Message: Displays a congratulatory message for completing the game and shows the final score and time.
REQ20 Game Over/Win Window: Play Again Button: Restarts the game at the same difficulty level.
REQ21 Game Over/Win Window: Change Difficulty Button: Returns the player to the "Select Difficulty" window to choose a new difficulty level.
REQ22 Game Over/Win Window: Main Menu Button: Returns to the Main Menu.
REQ23 Additional feature requirements: Game logic: Ability to shuffle and randomly place the cards at the start of each game.
REQ24 Additional feature requirements: Game logic: Mechanism to flip cards and reveal their faces when clicked.
REQ25 Additional feature requirements: Game logic: Check for matches when two cards are flipped; if they match, leave them face up, otherwise flip them back.
REQ26 Additional feature requirements: Game logic: Keep track of the number of attempts made and matches found.
REQ27 Additional feature requirements: Game logic: Implement a win condition when all matches are found.
REQ28 Additional feature requirements: Difficulty levels: Provide at least three levels of difficulty (e.g., Easy: 4x4 grid, Medium: 6x6 grid, Hard: 8x8 grid)..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
