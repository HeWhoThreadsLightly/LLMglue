[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a simple yet engaging Memory Match game that can be played on the desktop. The game will present the player with a grid of cards, face down. Each card has a matching counterpart somewhere in the grid. The objective of the game is for the player to find all the matching pairs by remembering the locations of cards they have previously turned over. This game can be enhanced with different themes, difficulty levels, and maybe even a timer to challenge the player further.
REQ1 Main menu window: Title: Display the game title prominently at the top.
REQ2 Main menu window: Play button: A button to start the game. Clicking this button takes the player to the "Select Difficulty" window.
REQ3 Main menu window: High scores button: Opens a window displaying the high scores from previous games, including the player's name, score, and time.
REQ4 Main menu window: Settings button: Leads to a settings window where players can adjust sound preferences, choose themes, and view game instructions.
REQ5 Main menu window: Exit button: A button to exit the game.
REQ6 Select difficulty window: Instruction text: A brief instruction on how to select the difficulty level.
REQ7 Select difficulty window: Difficulty level buttons: Buttons for each difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard). Clicking on one sets the game's difficulty and starts the game.
REQ8 Select difficulty window: Back button: Returns to the Main Menu.
REQ9 Game window: Game grid: The central area where the cards are displayed according to the chosen difficulty level. Cards should be arranged in a grid layout that changes size based on the difficulty.
REQ10 Game window: Score panel: A panel displaying the current number of attempts, number of matches found, and the elapsed time.
REQ11 Game Window: Pause/Menu Button: Pauses the game and opens a small menu with options to resume, restart, change difficulty, or return to the Main Menu.
REQ12 Settings window: Sound settings: Toggle switches for game sound effects and background music.
REQ13 Settings window: Theme selection: Dropdown menu or buttons to select the card and background theme.
REQ14 Settings window: Instructions: A section that outlines the game rules and controls.
REQ15 Settings window: Back button: Saves any changes and returns to the Main Menu.
REQ16 High scores window: Scores display: A list or table displaying the top scores, including details such as player name, score (based on attempts and time), and difficulty level.
REQ17 High scores window: Clear scores button: An option to clear the high score history.
REQ18 High scores window: Back button: Returns to the Main Menu.
REQ19 Game Over/Win Window: Message: Displays a congratulatory message for completing the game and shows the final score and time.
REQ20 Game Over/Win Window: Play Again Button: Restarts the game at the same difficulty level.
REQ21 Game Over/Win Window: Change Difficulty Button: Returns the player to the "Select Difficulty" window to choose a new difficulty level.
REQ22 Game Over/Win Window: Main Menu Button: Returns to the Main Menu..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the `start_game()` method in the `MainMenu` class. This method is responsible for starting the game by creating an instance of the `SelectDifficulty` class. To fix this, you need to add the following code to the `MainMenu` class:

```python
def start_game(self):
    self.destroy()
    select_difficulty = SelectDifficulty()
    select_difficulty.mainloop()
```

Additionally, you should also add comments to the code to improve its readability and maintainability.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the `start_game()` method in the `MainMenu` class. This method is responsible for starting the game by creating an instance of the `SelectDifficulty` class. To fix this, you need to add the following code to the `MainMenu` class:

```python
def start_game(self):
    self.destroy()
    select_difficulty = SelectDifficulty()
    select_difficulty.mainloop()
```

Additionally, you should also add comments to the code to improve its readability and maintainability."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

| **task_prompt** | Develop a simple yet engaging Memory Match game that can be played on the desktop. The game will present the player with a grid of cards, face down. Each card has a matching counterpart somewhere in the grid. The objective of the game is for the player to find all the matching pairs by remembering the locations of cards they have previously turned over. This game can be enhanced with different themes, difficulty levels, and maybe even a timer to challenge the player further. REQ1 Main menu window: Title: Display the game title prominently at the top. REQ2 Main menu window: Play button: A button to start the game. Clicking this button takes the player to the "Select Difficulty" window.

Here is a new customer's task: Develop a simple yet engaging Memory Match game that can be played on the desktop. The game will present the player with a grid of cards, face down. Each card has a matching counterpart somewhere in the grid. The objective of the game is for the player to find all the matching pairs by remembering the locations of cards they have previously turned over. This game can be enhanced with different themes, difficulty levels, and maybe even a timer to challenge the player further.
REQ1 Main menu window: Title: Display the game title prominently at the top.
REQ2 Main menu window: Play button: A button to start the game. Clicking this button takes the player to the "Select Difficulty" window.

REQ8 Select difficulty window: Back button: Returns to the Main Menu.
REQ9 Game window: Game grid: The central area where the cards are displayed according to the chosen difficulty level. Cards should be arranged in a grid layout that changes size based on the difficulty.
REQ10 Game window: Score panel: A panel displaying the current number of attempts, number of matches found, and the elapsed time.
REQ11 Game Window: Pause/Menu Button: Pauses the game and opens a small menu with options to resume, restart, change difficulty, or return to the Main Menu.
REQ12 Settings window: Sound settings: Toggle switches for game sound effects and background music.

REQ21 Game Over/Win Window: Change Difficulty Button: Returns the player to the "Select Difficulty" window to choose a new difficulty level.
REQ22 Game Over/Win Window: Main Menu Button: Returns to the Main Menu..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the `start_game()` method in the `MainMenu` class. This method should create an instance of the `SelectDifficulty` class and start the game. To fix this, add the following code to the `MainMenu` class:

```python
def start_game(self):
    self.destroy()
    select_difficulty = SelectDifficulty()
    select_difficulty.mainloop()
```

This will create a new instance of the `SelectDifficulty` class and start the game when the "Start Game" button is clicked.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the `start_game()` method in the `MainMenu` class. This method should create an instance of the `SelectDifficulty` class and start the game. To fix this, add the following code to the `MainMenu` class:

```python
def start_game(self):
    self.destroy()
    select_difficulty = SelectDifficulty()
    select_difficulty.mainloop()
```

This will create a new instance of the `SelectDifficulty` class and start the game when the "Start Game" button is clicked."

| **task_prompt** | Develop a simple yet engaging Memory Match game that can be played on the desktop. The game will present the player with a grid of cards, face down. Each card has a matching counterpart somewhere in the grid. The objective of the game is for the player to find all the matching pairs by remembering the locations of cards they have previously turned over. This game can be enhanced with different themes, difficulty levels, and maybe even a timer to challenge the player further. REQ1 Main menu window: Title: Display the game title prominently at the top. REQ2 Main menu window: Play button: A button to start the game. Clicking this button takes the player to the "Select Difficulty" window. REQ3 Main menu window: High scores button: Opens a window displaying the high scores from previous games, including the player's name, score, and time. REQ4 Main menu window: Settings button: Leads to a settings window where players can adjust sound preferences, choose themes, and view game instructions. REQ5 Main menu window: Exit button: A button to exit the game. REQ6 Select difficulty window: Instruction text: A brief instruction on how to select the difficulty level. REQ7 Select difficulty window: Difficulty level buttons: Buttons for each difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard). Clicking on one sets the game's difficulty and starts the game. REQ8 Select difficulty window: Back button: Returns to the Main Menu. REQ9 Game window: Game grid: The central area where the cards are displayed according to the chosen difficulty level. Cards should be arranged in a grid layout that changes size based on the difficulty. REQ10 Game window: Score panel: A panel displaying the current number of attempts, number of matches found, and the elapsed time. REQ11 Game Window: Pause/Menu Button: Pauses the game and opens a small menu with options to resume, restart, change difficulty, or return to the Main Menu. REQ12 Settings window: Sound settings: Toggle switches for game sound effects and background music. REQ13 Settings window: Theme selection: Dropdown menu or buttons to select the card and background theme. REQ14 Settings window: Instructions: A section that outlines the game rules and controls. REQ15 Settings window: Back button: Saves any changes and returns to the Main Menu.

Here is a new customer's task: Develop a simple yet engaging Memory Match game that can be played on the desktop. The game will present the player with a grid of cards, face down. Each card has a matching counterpart somewhere in the grid. The objective of the game is for the player to find all the matching pairs by remembering the locations of cards they have previously turned over. This game can be enhanced with different themes, difficulty levels, and maybe even a timer to challenge the player further.

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the `start_game()` method in the `MainMenu` class. This method should create an instance of the `SelectDifficulty` class and start the game. To fix this, add the following code to the `MainMenu` class:

```python
def start_game(self):
    self.destroy()
    select_difficulty = SelectDifficulty()
    select_difficulty.mainloop()
```

This will create an instance of the `SelectDifficulty` class and start the game when the "Start Game" button is clicked.

After making this change, the code should be ready for further testing and review.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the `start_game()` method in the `MainMenu` class. This method should create an instance of the `SelectDifficulty` class and start the game. To fix this, add the following code to the `MainMenu` class:

```python
def start_game(self):
    self.destroy()
    select_difficulty = SelectDifficulty()
    select_difficulty.mainloop()
```

This will create an instance of the `SelectDifficulty` class and start the game when the "Start Game" button is clicked.

After making this change, the code should be ready for further testing and review."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a simple yet engaging Memory Match game that can be played on the desktop. The game will present the player with a grid of cards, face down. Each card has a matching counterpart somewhere in the grid. The objective of the game is for the player to find all the matching pairs by remembering the locations of cards they have previously turned over. This game can be enhanced with different themes, difficulty levels, and maybe even a timer to challenge the player further.
REQ1 Main menu window: Title: Display the game title prominently at the top.
REQ2 Main menu window: Play button: A button to start the game. Clicking this button takes the player to the "Select Difficulty" window.
REQ3 Main menu window: High scores button: Opens a window displaying the high scores from previous games, including the player's name, score, and time.
REQ4 Main menu window: Settings button: Leads to a settings window where players can adjust sound preferences, choose themes, and view game instructions.
REQ5 Main menu window: Exit button: A button to exit the game.
REQ6 Select difficulty window: Instruction text: A brief instruction on how to select the difficulty level.
REQ7 Select difficulty window: Difficulty level buttons: Buttons for each difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard). Clicking on one sets the game's difficulty and starts the game.
REQ8 Select difficulty window: Back button: Returns to the Main Menu.
REQ9 Game window: Game grid: The central area where the cards are displayed according to the chosen difficulty level. Cards should be arranged in a grid layout that changes size based on the difficulty.
REQ10 Game window: Score panel: A panel displaying the current number of attempts, number of matches found, and the elapsed time.
REQ11 Game Window: Pause/Menu Button: Pauses the game and opens a small menu with options to resume, restart, change difficulty, or return to the Main Menu.
REQ12 Settings window: Sound settings: Toggle switches for game sound effects and background music.
REQ13 Settings window: Theme selection: Dropdown menu or buttons to select the card and background theme.
REQ14 Settings window: Instructions: A section that outlines the game rules and controls.
REQ15 Settings window: Back button: Saves any changes and returns to the Main Menu.
REQ16 High scores window: Scores display: A list or table displaying the top scores, including details such as player name, score (based on attempts and time), and difficulty level.
REQ17 High scores window: Clear scores button: An option to clear the high score history.
REQ18 High scores window: Back button: Returns to the Main Menu.
REQ19 Game Over/Win Window: Message: Displays a congratulatory message for completing the game and shows the final score and time.
REQ20 Game Over/Win Window: Play Again Button: Restarts the game at the same difficulty level.
REQ21 Game Over/Win Window: Change Difficulty Button: Returns the player to the "Select Difficulty" window to choose a new difficulty level.

Programming Language: "{language}" Ideas: "{ideas}" Codes:  "{codes}" Requirements: "{requirements}" As the {assistant_role}, by using Markdown, you should write a manual.md file which is a detailed user manual to use the software, including introducing main functions of the software, how to install environment dependencies and how to use/play it. For example: manual.md ``` LangChain Building applications with LLMs through composability Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js. Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel. Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)
