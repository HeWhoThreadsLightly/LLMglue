We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT>
The code is missing the necessary imports for the classes and modules used in the application. Specifically, the imports for `simpledialog`, `messagebox`, and `Label` are missing. These imports are required for the functionality of the application.

<SUGGESTION>
To fix this issue, add the following imports at the beginning of the `main.py` file:

```python
from tkinter import simpledialog, messagebox
from tkinter.ttk import Label
```

This will ensure that the necessary classes and modules are imported and available for use in the application.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code is missing the necessary imports for the classes and modules used in the application. Specifically, the imports for `simpledialog`, `messagebox`, and `Label` are missing. These imports are required for the functionality of the application.

<SUGGESTION>
To fix this issue, add the following imports at the beginning of the `main.py` file:

```python
from tkinter import simpledialog, messagebox
from tkinter.ttk import Label
```

This will ensure that the necessary classes and modules are imported and available for use in the application."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: The File Organizer and Content Manager (FOCM) is a desktop application designed to help users efficiently organize, search, and manage their local files. This software aims to enhance productivity and file management through automated organization, advanced search capabilities, and content management features. It will support various file types, including documents, images, videos, and more, providing a unified interface for managing digital content.
REQ1 User interface: Main window: The central hub of the application featuring a dual-pane layout: one pane for the directory tree (folders) and another for viewing the contents of the selected directory.
REQ2 User interface: Main window: A toolbar at the top with buttons for common actions (create new folder, delete file, refresh view, toggle between list/grid view, search bar).
REQ3 User interface: Main window: Status bar at the bottom displaying information about the selected files/folders and general statistics (total files, total size).
REQ4 User interface: Search and filter panel: A dedicated panel, accessible from the main window, allowing users to enter search criteria, choose filters (file type, date modified, size), and display results in a list or grid format.
REQ5 User interface: Search and filter panel: Advanced search options for more precise filtering, including full-text search within documents.
REQ6 User interface: File preview window: A pop-up or sidebar window that provides a quick preview of the selected file. For text documents and images, show a preview within the window. For videos and audio files, provide basic playback controls.
REQ7 User interface: File preview window: Edit mode for text files, enabling users to make quick edits directly within the preview window.
REQ8 User interface: File properties and metadata editor: A dialog box that displays when a user selects "Properties" from the context menu of a file/folder. Shows detailed information including file size, creation/modification dates, and allows the user to edit metadata tags.
REQ9 User interface: Settings/Preferences Window: A separate window accessible from the main menu, allowing users to customize application settings. This includes theme selection (dark/light), default views, file organization rules, backup settings, and extension/plugin management.
REQ10 User interface: Tag management interface: A panel or window for creating, editing, and deleting tags. Users can also assign tags to files or folders from this interface, providing a flexible way to categorize and locate files quickly.
REQ11 User interface: Backup and synchronization setup wizard: A step-by-step wizard that guides users through setting up backup destinations (external drive, cloud storage) and synchronization options, including scheduling automatic backups.
REQ12 User interface: Help and tutorial section: A dedicated window or section accessible from the main menu, offering a searchable help database, user manual, and interactive tutorials on key features.
REQ13 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: The application must allow users to create customizable rules for automatically organizing files. These rules can be based on:
REQ14 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: File type (e.g., documents, images, music, videos).
REQ15 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: Date criteria (e.g., creation date, modification date)..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT>
The code is missing the implementation of the `update_directory_tree` and `update_content_view` methods. These methods are responsible for updating the directory tree and content view with the current file system structure and the given list of files, respectively. Without these methods, the application will not display the correct file structure and content.

<SUGGESTION>
To fix this issue, you need to implement the `update_directory_tree` and `update_content_view` methods in the `MainWindow` class. Here's an example of how you can implement these methods:

```python
def update_directory_tree(self):
    '''
    Update the directory tree with the current file system structure
    '''
    self.directory_tree.delete(*self.directory_tree.get_children())
    for dirpath, dirnames, filenames in os.walk("."):
        parent = self.directory_tree.insert("", "end", text=dirpath, open=True)
        for dirname in dirnames:
            self.directory_tree.insert(parent, "end", text=dirname)
        for filename in filenames:
            self.directory_tree.insert(parent, "end", text=filename)

def update_content_view(self, files=None):
    '''
    Update the content view with the given list of files
    '''
    self.content_view.destroy()
    self.content_view = tk.Frame(self)
    self.content_view.pack(side=tk.LEFT, fill=tk.BOTH, expand=True)
    if files is None:
        files = []
    for file in files:
        if os.path.isdir(file):
            self.content_view.insert("end", text=file, tags=("folder",))
        else:
            self.content_view.insert("end", text=file, tags=("file",))
```

After implementing these methods, the directory tree and content view will be correctly updated when necessary.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code is missing the implementation of the `update_directory_tree` and `update_content_view` methods. These methods are responsible for updating the directory tree and content view with the current file system structure and the given list of files, respectively. Without these methods, the application will not display the correct file structure and content.

<SUGGESTION>
To fix this issue, you need to implement the `update_directory_tree` and `update_content_view` methods in the `MainWindow` class. Here's an example of how you can implement these methods:

```python
def update_directory_tree(self):
    '''
    Update the directory tree with the current file system structure
    '''
    self.directory_tree.delete(*self.directory_tree.get_children())
    for dirpath, dirnames, filenames in os.walk("."):
        parent = self.directory_tree.insert("", "end", text=dirpath, open=True)
        for dirname in dirnames:
            self.directory_tree.insert(parent, "end", text=dirname)
        for filename in filenames:
            self.directory_tree.insert(parent, "end", text=filename)

def update_content_view(self, files=None):
    '''
    Update the content view with the given list of files
    '''
    self.content_view.destroy()
    self.content_view = tk.Frame(self)
    self.content_view.pack(side=tk.LEFT, fill=tk.BOTH, expand=True)
    if files is None:
        files = []
    for file in files:
        if os.path.isdir(file):
            self.content_view.insert("end", text=file, tags=("folder",))
        else:
            self.content_view.insert("end", text=file, tags=("file",))
```

After implementing these methods, the directory tree and content view will be correctly updated when necessary."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Here is a new customer's task: The File Organizer and Content Manager (FOCM) is a desktop application designed to help users efficiently organize, search, and manage their local files. This software aims to enhance productivity and file management through automated organization, advanced search capabilities, and content management features. It will support various file types, including documents, images, videos, and more, providing a unified interface for managing digital content.
REQ1 User interface: Main window: The central hub of the application featuring a dual-pane layout: one pane for the directory tree (folders) and another for viewing the contents of the selected directory.
REQ2 User interface: Main window: A toolbar at the top with buttons for common actions (create new folder, delete file, refresh view, toggle between list/grid view, search bar).
REQ3 User interface: Main window: Status bar at the bottom displaying information about the selected files/folders and general statistics (total files, total size).
REQ4 User interface: Search and filter panel: A dedicated panel, accessible from the main window, allowing users to enter search criteria, choose filters (file type, date modified, size), and display results in a list or grid format.
REQ5 User interface: Search and filter panel: Advanced search options for more precise filtering, including full-text search within documents.
REQ6 User interface: File preview window: A pop-up or sidebar window that provides a quick preview of the selected file. For text documents and images, show a preview within the window. For videos and audio files, provide basic playback controls.
REQ7 User interface: File preview window: Edit mode for text files, enabling users to make quick edits directly within the preview window.
REQ8 User interface: File properties and metadata editor: A dialog box that displays when a user selects "Properties" from the context menu of a file/folder. Shows detailed information including file size, creation/modification dates, and allows the user to edit metadata tags.
REQ9 User interface: Settings/Preferences Window: A separate window accessible from the main menu, allowing users to customize application settings. This includes theme selection (dark/light), default views, file organization rules, backup settings, and extension/plugin management.
REQ10 User interface: Tag management interface: A panel or window for creating, editing, and deleting tags. Users can also assign tags to files or folders from this interface, providing a flexible way to categorize and locate files quickly.
REQ11 User interface: Backup and synchronization setup wizard: A step-by-step wizard that guides users through setting up backup destinations (external drive, cloud storage) and synchronization options, including scheduling automatic backups.
REQ12 User interface: Help and tutorial section: A dedicated window or section accessible from the main menu, offering a searchable help database, user manual, and interactive tutorials on key features.
REQ13 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: The application must allow users to create customizable rules for automatically organizing files. These rules can be based on:

Here\'s an example of how you can implement these methods:\n\npython\ndef update_directory_tree(self):\n    \'\'\'\n    Update the directory tree with the current file system structure\n    \'\'\'\n    self.directory_tree.delete(*self.directory_tree.get_children())\n    for dirpath, dirnames, filenames in os.walk("."):\n        parent = self.directory_tree.insert("", "end", text=dirpath, open=True)\n        for dirname in dirnames:\n            self.directory_tree.insert(parent, "end", text=dirname)\n        for filename in filenames:\n            self.directory_tree.insert(parent, "end", text=filename)\n\ndef update_content_view(self, files=None):\n    \'\'\'\n    Update the content view with the given list of files\n    \'\'\'\n    self.content_view.destroy()\n    self.content_view = tk.Frame(self)\n    self.content_view.pack(side=tk.LEFT, fill=tk.BOTH, expand=True)\n    if files is None:\n        files = []\n    for file in files:\n        if os.path.isdir(file):\n            self.content_view.insert("end", text=file, tags=("folder",))\n        else:\n            self.content_view.insert("end", text=file, tags=("file",))\n\n\nAfter implementing these methods, the directory tree and content view will be correctly updated when necessary.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT>
The code is missing the implementation of the `update_directory_tree` and `update_content_view` methods. These methods are called in the `refresh_view` method but are not defined in the code. 

<SUGGESTION>
To fix this issue, you need to add the implementation of the `update_directory_tree` and `update_content_view` methods. These methods should update the directory tree and content view based on the current file system structure and the given list of files, respectively.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code is missing the implementation of the `update_directory_tree` and `update_content_view` methods. These methods are called in the `refresh_view` method but are not defined in the code. 

<SUGGESTION>
To fix this issue, you need to add the implementation of the `update_directory_tree` and `update_content_view` methods. These methods should update the directory tree and content view based on the current file system structure and the given list of files, respectively."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
