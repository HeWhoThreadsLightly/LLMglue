Ideas: "".

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of several methods, such as `create_new_folder`, `delete_file`, `refresh_view`, `toggle_view`, `perform_search`, `update_directory_tree`, and `update_content_view`. These methods are essential for the functionality of the application. 

To fix this, you need to implement these methods by adding the necessary code to perform the respective actions. For example, in the `create_new_folder` method, you need to prompt the user for a new folder name, create the folder using `os.mkdir`, and update the directory tree. Similarly, in the `delete_file` method, you need to prompt the user for confirmation, delete the selected file using `os.remove`, and show appropriate messages. 

Please review the code and implement the missing methods accordingly.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of several methods, such as `create_new_folder`, `delete_file`, `refresh_view`, `toggle_view`, `perform_search`, `update_directory_tree`, and `update_content_view`. These methods are essential for the functionality of the application. 

To fix this, you need to implement these methods by adding the necessary code to perform the respective actions. For example, in the `create_new_folder` method, you need to prompt the user for a new folder name, create the folder using `os.mkdir`, and update the directory tree. Similarly, in the `delete_file` method, you need to prompt the user for confirmation, delete the selected file using `os.remove`, and show appropriate messages. 

Please review the code and implement the missing methods accordingly."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: The File Organizer and Content Manager (FOCM) is a desktop application designed to help users efficiently organize, search, and manage their local files. This software aims to enhance productivity and file management through automated organization, advanced search capabilities, and content management features. It will support various file types, including documents, images, videos, and more, providing a unified interface for managing digital content.
REQ1 User interface: Main window: The central hub of the application featuring a dual-pane layout: one pane for the directory tree (folders) and another for viewing the contents of the selected directory.
REQ2 User interface: Main window: A toolbar at the top with buttons for common actions (create new folder, delete file, refresh view, toggle between list/grid view, search bar).
REQ3 User interface: Main window: Status bar at the bottom displaying information about the selected files/folders and general statistics (total files, total size).
REQ4 User interface: Search and filter panel: A dedicated panel, accessible from the main window, allowing users to enter search criteria, choose filters (file type, date modified, size), and display results in a list or grid format.
REQ5 User interface: Search and filter panel: Advanced search options for more precise filtering, including full-text search within documents.
REQ6 User interface: File preview window: A pop-up or sidebar window that provides a quick preview of the selected file. For text documents and images, show a preview within the window. For videos and audio files, provide basic playback controls.
REQ7 User interface: File preview window: Edit mode for text files, enabling users to make quick edits directly within the preview window.
REQ8 User interface: File properties and metadata editor: A dialog box that displays when a user selects "Properties" from the context menu of a file/folder. Shows detailed information including file size, creation/modification dates, and allows the user to edit metadata tags.
REQ9 User interface: Settings/Preferences Window: A separate window accessible from the main menu, allowing users to customize application settings. This includes theme selection (dark/light), default views, file organization rules, backup settings, and extension/plugin management.
REQ10 User interface: Tag management interface: A panel or window for creating, editing, and deleting tags. Users can also assign tags to files or folders from this interface, providing a flexible way to categorize and locate files quickly.
REQ11 User interface: Backup and synchronization setup wizard: A step-by-step wizard that guides users through setting up backup destinations (external drive, cloud storage) and synchronization options, including scheduling automatic backups.
REQ12 User interface: Help and tutorial section: A dedicated window or section accessible from the main menu, offering a searchable help database, user manual, and interactive tutorials on key features.
REQ13 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: The application must allow users to create customizable rules for automatically organizing files. These rules can be based on:
REQ14 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: File type (e.g., documents, images, music, videos).
REQ15 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: Date criteria (e.g., creation date, modification date).
REQ16 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: File name patterns (e.g., using wildcards or regular expressions).
REQ17 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: File size thresholds.
REQ18 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: Users should be able to specify the target folder structure for organized files, with options to create new folders based on rule criteria (e.g., date, project name).
REQ19 File organization requirements: Manual tagging and categorization: Users must be able to assign custom tags to files and folders manually.
REQ20 File organization requirements: Manual tagging and categorization: The application should offer a tagging interface that suggests existing tags as the user types and allows the creation of new tags.
REQ21 File organization requirements: Manual tagging and categorization: Support for creating custom categories where users can group files/folders based on project, client, priority, or any other user-defined category.
REQ22 File organization requirements: Manual tagging and categorization: Users should be able to view and access files by tags and categories through a dedicated interface or filter.
REQ23 File organization requirements: Bulk file operations: The application must support bulk operations to rename, move, copy, or delete multiple files at once based on user selection.
REQ24 File organization requirements: Bulk file operations: Include options for bulk applying tags or moving files to a category, with undo functionality to revert changes if needed.
REQ25 File organization requirements: Folder and file management: Users must be able to create, rename, move, and delete files and folders from within the application.
REQ26 File organization requirements: Folder and file management: The application should provide a drag-and-drop interface for moving files and folders into different categories or locations.
REQ27 File organization requirements: Folder and file management: Include a feature to detect and resolve duplicate files based on name, size, and optionally content hash. The application should offer options to keep, delete, or merge duplicate files.
REQ28 File organization requirements: Custom folder views and sorting: Allow users to customize how folders and files are displayed (e.g., list, grid, thumbnail views).
REQ29 File organization requirements: Custom folder views and sorting: Support for sorting files and folders by name, size, date modified, or custom tags/categories.
REQ30 File Organization Requirements: File Watcher and Auto-Update: Implement a file watcher mechanism that automatically updates file organization based on predefined rules when new files are added to monitored folders.
REQ31 File Organization Requirements: File Watcher and Auto-Update: This feature should work in real-time or at user-defined intervals, ensuring the organization structure is always up-to-date.
REQ32 File organization requirements: Integration with file system: The application should integrate closely with the operating system's file system to reflect changes made within the app in real-time in the user's file explorer or finder.
REQ33 File organization requirements: Integration with file system: Support for right-click context menu options in the operating system’s file explorer to quickly tag, categorize, or apply predefined organization rules to selected files or folders.
REQ34 Search and filter requirements: Advanced search functionality: Ability to search for files and folders using partial or full file names.
REQ35 Search and filter requirements: Advanced search functionality: Content-based search capabilities that allow users to find files containing specific text, even within documents or metadata for images and videos.
REQ36 Search and filter requirements: Advanced search functionality: Support for regular expressions (regex) in search queries for complex pattern matching.
REQ37 Search and filter requirements: Custom search filters: Predefined filters to quickly select files based on common criteria such as file type (e.g., documents, images, videos), size (e.g., less than 10MB), and modification or creation date (e.g., last 7 days).
REQ38 Search and filter requirements: Custom search filters: User-defined filters where users can create, save, and apply custom filter sets based on any combination of file attributes, including custom tags, project names, or specific content.
REQ39 Search and Filter Requirements: Tag-Based Searching: Integration of a tagging system where users can assign custom tags to files and folders, and then search for these tags.
REQ40 Search and Filter Requirements: Tag-Based Searching: Support for hierarchical tags (e.g., Work/Project1, Personal/Photos) to facilitate detailed organization and searching.
REQ41 Search and filter requirements: Search history and saved searches: Automatic saving of recent searches for quick repetition..

<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of several methods, including the methods for creating the directory tree, content view, toolbar, status bar, and performing search. Additionally, there are missing comments throughout the code. 

To fix this, you need to implement the missing methods and add the necessary comments to the code. Here are the specific steps you can follow:

1. Implement the `create_directory_tree` method to create the directory tree pane in the main window. This method should create a `Treeview` widget and pack it to the left side of the window. You should also call the `update_directory_tree` method to update the directory tree with the current file system structure.

2. Implement the `create_content_view` method to create the content view pane in the main window. This method should create a `Treeview` widget and pack it to the left side of the window.

3. Implement the `create_toolbar` method to create the toolbar with buttons for common actions in the main window. This method should create a `Frame` widget and pack it to the top of the window. Inside the toolbar, you should create buttons for new folder, delete file, refresh view, toggle view, and a search bar. You should also bind the appropriate command functions to the buttons.

4. Implement the `create_status_bar` method to create the status bar displaying information in the main window. This method should create a `Label` widget and pack it to the bottom of the window.

5. Implement the `perform_search` method to handle the logic for performing a search. This method should get the search query from the search bar, perform the search using the `glob` module, and update the content view with the search results.

6. Add comments throughout the code to explain the purpose and functionality of each method and section of code. This will make the code more readable and maintainable.

Once you have implemented the missing methods and added the necessary comments, the code should be complete and ready for testing.

Here are the specific steps you can follow:\n\n1. Implement the create_directory_tree method to create the directory tree pane in the main window. This method should create a Treeview widget and pack it to the left side of the window. You should also call the update_directory_tree method to update the directory tree with the current file system structure.\n\n2. Implement the create_content_view method to create the content view pane in the main window. This method should create a Treeview widget and pack it to the left side of the window.\n\n3. Implement the create_toolbar method to create the toolbar with buttons for common actions in the main window. This method should create a Frame widget and pack it to the top of the window. Inside the toolbar, you should create buttons for new folder, delete file, refresh view, toggle view, and a search bar. You should also bind the appropriate command functions to the buttons.\n\n4. Implement the create_status_bar method to create the status bar displaying information in the main window. This method should create a Label widget and pack it to the bottom of the window.\n\n5. Implement the perform_search method to handle the logic for performing a search. This method should get the search query from the search bar, perform the search using the glob module, and update the content view with the search results.\n\n6. Add comments throughout the code to explain the purpose and functionality of each method and section of code. This will make the code more readable and maintainable.\n\nOnce you have implemented the missing methods and added the necessary comments, the code should be complete and ready for testing.'} |

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of several methods, including the methods for creating the directory tree, content view, toolbar, status bar, and performing search. Additionally, there are missing comments throughout the code. 

To fix this, you need to implement the missing methods and add the necessary comments to the code. Here are the specific steps you can follow:

1. Implement the `create_directory_tree` method to create the directory tree pane in the main window. This method should create a `Treeview` widget and pack it to the left side of the window. You should also call the `update_directory_tree` method to update the directory tree with the current file system structure.

2. Implement the `create_content_view` method to create the content view pane in the main window. This method should create a `Treeview` widget and pack it to the left side of the window.

3. Implement the `create_toolbar` method to create the toolbar with buttons for common actions in the main window. This method should create a `Frame` widget and pack it to the top of the window. Inside the toolbar, you should create buttons for new folder, delete file, refresh view, toggle view, and a search bar. You should also bind the appropriate command functions to the buttons.

4. Implement the `create_status_bar` method to create the status bar displaying information in the main window. This method should create a `Label` widget and pack it to the bottom of the window.

5. Implement the `perform_search` method to handle the logic for performing a search. This method should get the search query from the search bar, perform the search using the `glob` module, and update the content view with the search results.

6. Add comments throughout the code to explain the purpose and functionality of each method and section of code. This will make the code more readable and maintainable.

Once you have implemented the missing methods and added the necessary comments, the code should be complete and ready for testing."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: The File Organizer and Content Manager (FOCM) is a desktop application designed to help users efficiently organize, search, and manage their local files. This software aims to enhance productivity and file management through automated organization, advanced search capabilities, and content management features. It will support various file types, including documents, images, videos, and more, providing a unified interface for managing digital content.
REQ1 User interface: Main window: The central hub of the application featuring a dual-pane layout: one pane for the directory tree (folders) and another for viewing the contents of the selected directory.
REQ2 User interface: Main window: A toolbar at the top with buttons for common actions (create new folder, delete file, refresh view, toggle between list/grid view, search bar).
REQ3 User interface: Main window: Status bar at the bottom displaying information about the selected files/folders and general statistics (total files, total size).
REQ4 User interface: Search and filter panel: A dedicated panel, accessible from the main window, allowing users to enter search criteria, choose filters (file type, date modified, size), and display results in a list or grid format.
REQ5 User interface: Search and filter panel: Advanced search options for more precise filtering, including full-text search within documents.
REQ6 User interface: File preview window: A pop-up or sidebar window that provides a quick preview of the selected file. For text documents and images, show a preview within the window. For videos and audio files, provide basic playback controls.
REQ7 User interface: File preview window: Edit mode for text files, enabling users to make quick edits directly within the preview window.
REQ8 User interface: File properties and metadata editor: A dialog box that displays when a user selects "Properties" from the context menu of a file/folder. Shows detailed information including file size, creation/modification dates, and allows the user to edit metadata tags.
REQ9 User interface: Settings/Preferences Window: A separate window accessible from the main menu, allowing users to customize application settings. This includes theme selection (dark/light), default views, file organization rules, backup settings, and extension/plugin management.
REQ10 User interface: Tag management interface: A panel or window for creating, editing, and deleting tags. Users can also assign tags to files or folders from this interface, providing a flexible way to categorize and locate files quickly.
REQ11 User interface: Backup and synchronization setup wizard: A step-by-step wizard that guides users through setting up backup destinations (external drive, cloud storage) and synchronization options, including scheduling automatic backups.
REQ12 User interface: Help and tutorial section: A dedicated window or section accessible from the main menu, offering a searchable help database, user manual, and interactive tutorials on key features.
REQ13 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: The application must allow users to create customizable rules for automatically organizing files. These rules can be based on:
REQ14 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: File type (e.g., documents, images, music, videos).
REQ15 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: Date criteria (e.g., creation date, modification date).

You should also call the update_directory_tree method to update the directory tree with the current file system structure.\n\n2. Implement the create_content_view method to create the content view pane in the main window. This method should create a Treeview widget and pack it to the left side of the window.\n\n3. Implement the create_toolbar method to create the toolbar with buttons for common actions in the main window. This method should create a Frame widget and pack it to the top of the window. Inside the toolbar, you should create buttons for new folder, delete file, refresh view, toggle view, and a search bar. You should also bind the appropriate command functions to the buttons.\n\n4. Implement the create_status_bar method to create the status bar displaying information in the main window. This method should create a Label widget and pack it to the bottom of the window.\n\n5. Implement the perform_search method to handle the logic for performing a search. This method should get the search query from the search bar, perform the search using the glob module, and update the content view with the search results.\n\n6. Add comments throughout the code to explain the purpose and functionality of each method and section of code. This will make the code more readable and maintainable.\n\nOnce you have implemented the missing methods and added the necessary comments, the code should be complete and ready for testing.'} |

<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of several methods, such as `create_new_folder`, `delete_file`, `refresh_view`, `toggle_view`, `perform_search`, `update_directory_tree`, and `update_content_view`. These methods are essential for the functionality of the application. Additionally, there are no comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each method. 

To fix this, you need to implement the missing methods and add comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each method.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of several methods, such as `create_new_folder`, `delete_file`, `refresh_view`, `toggle_view`, `perform_search`, `update_directory_tree`, and `update_content_view`. These methods are essential for the functionality of the application. Additionally, there are no comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each method. 

To fix this, you need to implement the missing methods and add comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each method."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Here is a new customer's task: The File Organizer and Content Manager (FOCM) is a desktop application designed to help users efficiently organize, search, and manage their local files. This software aims to enhance productivity and file management through automated organization, advanced search capabilities, and content management features. It will support various file types, including documents, images, videos, and more, providing a unified interface for managing digital content.
REQ1 User interface: Main window: The central hub of the application featuring a dual-pane layout: one pane for the directory tree (folders) and another for viewing the contents of the selected directory.
REQ2 User interface: Main window: A toolbar at the top with buttons for common actions (create new folder, delete file, refresh view, toggle between list/grid view, search bar).
REQ3 User interface: Main window: Status bar at the bottom displaying information about the selected files/folders and general statistics (total files, total size).
REQ4 User interface: Search and filter panel: A dedicated panel, accessible from the main window, allowing users to enter search criteria, choose filters (file type, date modified, size), and display results in a list or grid format.
REQ5 User interface: Search and filter panel: Advanced search options for more precise filtering, including full-text search within documents.
REQ6 User interface: File preview window: A pop-up or sidebar window that provides a quick preview of the selected file. For text documents and images, show a preview within the window. For videos and audio files, provide basic playback controls.
REQ7 User interface: File preview window: Edit mode for text files, enabling users to make quick edits directly within the preview window.
REQ8 User interface: File properties and metadata editor: A dialog box that displays when a user selects "Properties" from the context menu of a file/folder. Shows detailed information including file size, creation/modification dates, and allows the user to edit metadata tags.
REQ9 User interface: Settings/Preferences Window: A separate window accessible from the main menu, allowing users to customize application settings. This includes theme selection (dark/light), default views, file organization rules, backup settings, and extension/plugin management.
REQ10 User interface: Tag management interface: A panel or window for creating, editing, and deleting tags. Users can also assign tags to files or folders from this interface, providing a flexible way to categorize and locate files quickly.
REQ11 User interface: Backup and synchronization setup wizard: A step-by-step wizard that guides users through setting up backup destinations (external drive, cloud storage) and synchronization options, including scheduling automatic backups.
REQ12 User interface: Help and tutorial section: A dedicated window or section accessible from the main menu, offering a searchable help database, user manual, and interactive tutorials on key features.
REQ13 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: The application must allow users to create customizable rules for automatically organizing files. These rules can be based on:
REQ14 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: File type (e.g., documents, images, music, videos).
REQ15 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: Date criteria (e.g., creation date, modification date).
REQ16 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: File name patterns (e.g., using wildcards or regular expressions).
REQ17 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: File size thresholds.
REQ18 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: Users should be able to specify the target folder structure for organized files, with options to create new folders based on rule criteria (e.g., date, project name).
REQ19 File organization requirements: Manual tagging and categorization: Users must be able to assign custom tags to files and folders manually.
REQ20 File organization requirements: Manual tagging and categorization: The application should offer a tagging interface that suggests existing tags as the user types and allows the creation of new tags.
REQ21 File organization requirements: Manual tagging and categorization: Support for creating custom categories where users can group files/folders based on project, client, priority, or any other user-defined category.
REQ22 File organization requirements: Manual tagging and categorization: Users should be able to view and access files by tags and categories through a dedicated interface or filter.
REQ23 File organization requirements: Bulk file operations: The application must support bulk operations to rename, move, copy, or delete multiple files at once based on user selection.
REQ24 File organization requirements: Bulk file operations: Include options for bulk applying tags or moving files to a category, with undo functionality to revert changes if needed.
REQ25 File organization requirements: Folder and file management: Users must be able to create, rename, move, and delete files and folders from within the application.
REQ26 File organization requirements: Folder and file management: The application should provide a drag-and-drop interface for moving files and folders into different categories or locations.
REQ27 File organization requirements: Folder and file management: Include a feature to detect and resolve duplicate files based on name, size, and optionally content hash. The application should offer options to keep, delete, or merge duplicate files.
REQ28 File organization requirements: Custom folder views and sorting: Allow users to customize how folders and files are displayed (e.g., list, grid, thumbnail views).
REQ29 File organization requirements: Custom folder views and sorting: Support for sorting files and folders by name, size, date modified, or custom tags/categories.
REQ30 File Organization Requirements: File Watcher and Auto-Update: Implement a file watcher mechanism that automatically updates file organization based on predefined rules when new files are added to monitored folders.
REQ31 File Organization Requirements: File Watcher and Auto-Update: This feature should work in real-time or at user-defined intervals, ensuring the organization structure is always up-to-date.
REQ32 File organization requirements: Integration with file system: The application should integrate closely with the operating system's file system to reflect changes made within the app in real-time in the user's file explorer or finder.
REQ33 File organization requirements: Integration with file system: Support for right-click context menu options in the operating system’s file explorer to quickly tag, categorize, or apply predefined organization rules to selected files or folders.
REQ34 Search and filter requirements: Advanced search functionality: Ability to search for files and folders using partial or full file names.
REQ35 Search and filter requirements: Advanced search functionality: Content-based search capabilities that allow users to find files containing specific text, even within documents or metadata for images and videos.
REQ36 Search and filter requirements: Advanced search functionality: Support for regular expressions (regex) in search queries for complex pattern matching.
REQ37 Search and filter requirements: Custom search filters: Predefined filters to quickly select files based on common criteria such as file type (e.g., documents, images, videos), size (e.g., less than 10MB), and modification or creation date (e.g., last 7 days).
REQ38 Search and filter requirements: Custom search filters: User-defined filters where users can create, save, and apply custom filter sets based on any combination of file attributes, including custom tags, project names, or specific content.
REQ39 Search and Filter Requirements: Tag-Based Searching: Integration of a tagging system where users can assign custom tags to files and folders, and then search for these tags.
REQ40 Search and Filter Requirements: Tag-Based Searching: Support for hierarchical tags (e.g., Work/Project1, Personal/Photos) to facilitate detailed organization and searching.
REQ41 Search and filter requirements: Search history and saved searches: Automatic saving of recent searches for quick repetition..

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel. Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

1. Main Window: The central hub of the application featuring a dual-pane layout. One pane displays the directory tree (folders), and the other pane shows the contents of the selected directory.

2. Toolbar: A toolbar at the top of the main window with buttons for common actions such as creating a new folder, deleting a file, refreshing the view, toggling between list/grid view, and a search bar.

3. Status Bar: A status bar at the bottom of the main window displaying information about the selected files/folders and general statistics such as the total number of files and total size.

4. Search and Filter Panel: A dedicated panel accessible from the main window that allows users to enter search criteria, choose filters (file type, date modified, size), and display results in a list or grid format.

5. File Preview Window: A pop-up or sidebar window that provides a quick preview of the selected file. For text documents and images, a preview is shown within the window. For videos and audio files, basic playback controls are provided.

6. File Properties and Metadata Editor: A dialog box that displays detailed information about a selected file/folder, including file size, creation/modification dates. It also allows the user to edit metadata tags.

7. Settings/Preferences Window: A separate window accessible from the main menu that allows users to customize application settings such as theme selection (dark/light), default views, file organization rules, backup settings, and extension/plugin management.

8. Tag Management Interface: A panel or window for creating, editing, and deleting tags. Users can assign tags to files or folders from this interface, providing a flexible way to categorize and locate files quickly.

9. Backup and Synchronization Setup Wizard: A step-by-step wizard that guides users through setting up backup destinations (external drive, cloud storage) and synchronization options, including scheduling automatic backups.

10. Help and Tutorial Section: A dedicated window or section accessible from the main menu that offers a searchable help database, user manual, and interactive tutorials on key features.

### File Organization

FOCM provides powerful file organization features to help you keep your files organized:

1. Automated Organization Rules: FOCM allows users to create customizable rules for automatically organizing files based on file type, date criteria, file name patterns, and file size thresholds. Users can specify the target folder structure for organized files and create new folders based on rule criteria.

2. Manual Tagging and Categorization: Users can assign custom tags to files and folders manually. FOCM offers a tagging interface that suggests existing tags as the user types and allows the creation of new tags. Users can also create custom categories to group files/folders based on project, client, priority, or any other user-defined category.

3. Bulk File Operations: FOCM supports bulk operations to rename, move, copy, or delete multiple files at once based on user selection. Users can also bulk apply tags or move files to a category, with undo functionality to revert changes if needed.

4. Folder and File Management: Users can create, rename, move, and delete files and folders from within the application. FOCM provides a drag-and-drop interface for moving files and folders into different categories or locations. It also includes a feature to detect and resolve duplicate files based on name, size, and optionally content hash.

5. Custom Folder Views and Sorting: FOCM allows users to customize how folders and files are displayed with options for list, grid, and thumbnail views. Users can sort files and folders by name, size, date modified, or custom tags/categories.

6. File Watcher and Auto-Update: FOCM implements a file watcher mechanism that automatically updates file organization based on predefined rules when new files are added to monitored folders. This feature works in real-time or at user-defined intervals, ensuring the organization structure is always up-to-date.

7. Integration with File System: FOCM integrates closely with the operating system's file system to reflect changes made within the app in real-time in the user's file explorer or finder. It supports right-click context menu options in the operating system's file explorer to quickly tag, categorize, or apply predefined organization rules to selected files or folders.

### Search and Filter

FOCM provides advanced search and filter capabilities to help you find files and folders quickly:

1. Advanced Search Functionality: FOCM allows you to search for files and folders using partial or full file names. It also supports content-based search capabilities, allowing you to find files containing specific text, even within documents or metadata for images and videos. Regular expressions (regex) can be used in search queries for complex pattern matching.

2. Custom Search Filters: FOCM offers predefined filters to quickly select files based on common criteria such as file type, size, and modification or creation date. Users can also create, save, and apply custom filter sets based on any combination of file attributes, including custom tags, project names, or specific content.

3. Tag-Based Searching: FOCM integrates a tagging system where users can assign custom tags to files and folders. Users can search for files based on these tags. FOCM supports hierarchical tags to facilitate detailed organization and searching.
