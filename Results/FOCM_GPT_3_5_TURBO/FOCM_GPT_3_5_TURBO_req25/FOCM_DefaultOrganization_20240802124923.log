<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the `update_content_view` method. This method is responsible for updating the content view with the given list of files. It should delete the existing items in the content view and insert new items based on the provided files. The method should also assign appropriate tags to differentiate between folders and files.

To fix this issue, you need to implement the `update_content_view` method and add the necessary logic to update the content view. Here's an example of how the method could be implemented:

```python
def update_content_view(self, files=None):
    '''
    Update the content view with the given list of files
    '''
    self.content_view.delete(*self.content_view.get_children())
    if files is None:
        files = []
    for file in files:
        if os.path.isdir(file):
            self.content_view.insert("", "end", text=file, tags=("folder",))
        else:
            self.content_view.insert("", "end", text=file, tags=("file",))
```

Make sure to add this implementation to the `MainWindow` class in the `main.py` file. Once you've made this change, the `update_content_view` method will correctly update the content view based on the provided files.

Once you\'ve made this change, the update_content_view method will correctly update the content view based on the provided files.'} |

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the `update_content_view` method. This method is responsible for updating the content view with the given list of files. It should delete the existing items in the content view and insert new items based on the provided files. The method should also assign appropriate tags to differentiate between folders and files.

To fix this issue, you need to implement the `update_content_view` method and add the necessary logic to update the content view. Here's an example of how the method could be implemented:

```python
def update_content_view(self, files=None):
    '''
    Update the content view with the given list of files
    '''
    self.content_view.delete(*self.content_view.get_children())
    if files is None:
        files = []
    for file in files:
        if os.path.isdir(file):
            self.content_view.insert("", "end", text=file, tags=("folder",))
        else:
            self.content_view.insert("", "end", text=file, tags=("file",))
```

Make sure to add this implementation to the `MainWindow` class in the `main.py` file. Once you've made this change, the `update_content_view` method will correctly update the content view based on the provided files."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: The File Organizer and Content Manager (FOCM) is a desktop application designed to help users efficiently organize, search, and manage their local files. This software aims to enhance productivity and file management through automated organization, advanced search capabilities, and content management features. It will support various file types, including documents, images, videos, and more, providing a unified interface for managing digital content.
REQ1 User interface: Main window: The central hub of the application featuring a dual-pane layout: one pane for the directory tree (folders) and another for viewing the contents of the selected directory.
REQ2 User interface: Main window: A toolbar at the top with buttons for common actions (create new folder, delete file, refresh view, toggle between list/grid view, search bar).
REQ3 User interface: Main window: Status bar at the bottom displaying information about the selected files/folders and general statistics (total files, total size).
REQ4 User interface: Search and filter panel: A dedicated panel, accessible from the main window, allowing users to enter search criteria, choose filters (file type, date modified, size), and display results in a list or grid format.
REQ5 User interface: Search and filter panel: Advanced search options for more precise filtering, including full-text search within documents.
REQ6 User interface: File preview window: A pop-up or sidebar window that provides a quick preview of the selected file. For text documents and images, show a preview within the window. For videos and audio files, provide basic playback controls.
REQ7 User interface: File preview window: Edit mode for text files, enabling users to make quick edits directly within the preview window.
REQ8 User interface: File properties and metadata editor: A dialog box that displays when a user selects "Properties" from the context menu of a file/folder. Shows detailed information including file size, creation/modification dates, and allows the user to edit metadata tags.
REQ9 User interface: Settings/Preferences Window: A separate window accessible from the main menu, allowing users to customize application settings. This includes theme selection (dark/light), default views, file organization rules, backup settings, and extension/plugin management.
REQ10 User interface: Tag management interface: A panel or window for creating, editing, and deleting tags. Users can also assign tags to files or folders from this interface, providing a flexible way to categorize and locate files quickly.
REQ11 User interface: Backup and synchronization setup wizard: A step-by-step wizard that guides users through setting up backup destinations (external drive, cloud storage) and synchronization options, including scheduling automatic backups.
REQ12 User interface: Help and tutorial section: A dedicated window or section accessible from the main menu, offering a searchable help database, user manual, and interactive tutorials on key features.
REQ13 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: The application must allow users to create customizable rules for automatically organizing files. These rules can be based on:
REQ14 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: File type (e.g., documents, images, music, videos).
REQ15 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: Date criteria (e.g., creation date, modification date).
REQ16 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: File name patterns (e.g., using wildcards or regular expressions).
REQ17 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: File size thresholds.
REQ18 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: Users should be able to specify the target folder structure for organized files, with options to create new folders based on rule criteria (e.g., date, project name).
REQ19 File organization requirements: Manual tagging and categorization: Users must be able to assign custom tags to files and folders manually.
REQ20 File organization requirements: Manual tagging and categorization: The application should offer a tagging interface that suggests existing tags as the user types and allows the creation of new tags.
REQ21 File organization requirements: Manual tagging and categorization: Support for creating custom categories where users can group files/folders based on project, client, priority, or any other user-defined category.
REQ22 File organization requirements: Manual tagging and categorization: Users should be able to view and access files by tags and categories through a dedicated interface or filter.

The code has been modified to include the missing `update_content_view` method. This method updates the content view based on the provided list of files. It deletes the existing items in the content view and inserts new items based on the files, assigning appropriate tags to differentiate between folders and files.

The `update_content_view` method has been added to the `MainWindow` class in the `main.py` file. The method is called in the `refresh_view` method to update the content view when the view is refreshed.

With these modifications, the code should now correctly update the content view based on the provided files.

The code has been modified to include the missing `update_content_view` method. This method updates the content view based on the provided list of files. It deletes the existing items in the content view and inserts new items based on the files, assigning appropriate tags to differentiate between folders and files.

The `update_content_view` method has been added to the `MainWindow` class in the `main.py` file. The method is called in the `refresh_view` method to update the content view when the view is refreshed.

With these modifications, the code should now correctly update the content view based on the provided files.

REQ2 User interface: Main window: A toolbar at the top with buttons for common actions (create new folder, delete file, refresh view, toggle between list/grid view, search bar).
REQ3 User interface: Main window: Status bar at the bottom displaying information about the selected files/folders and general statistics (total files, total size).
REQ4 User interface: Search and filter panel: A dedicated panel, accessible from the main window, allowing users to enter search criteria, choose filters (file type, date modified, size), and display results in a list or grid format.
REQ5 User interface: Search and filter panel: Advanced search options for more precise filtering, including full-text search within documents.
REQ6 User interface: File preview window: A pop-up or sidebar window that provides a quick preview of the selected file. For text documents and images, show a preview within the window. For videos and audio files, provide basic playback controls.
REQ7 User interface: File preview window: Edit mode for text files, enabling users to make quick edits directly within the preview window.
REQ8 User interface: File properties and metadata editor: A dialog box that displays when a user selects "Properties" from the context menu of a file/folder. Shows detailed information including file size, creation/modification dates, and allows the user to edit metadata tags.
REQ9 User interface: Settings/Preferences Window: A separate window accessible from the main menu, allowing users to customize application settings. This includes theme selection (dark/light), default views, file organization rules, backup settings, and extension/plugin management.
REQ10 User interface: Tag management interface: A panel or window for creating, editing, and deleting tags. Users can also assign tags to files or folders from this interface, providing a flexible way to categorize and locate files quickly.
REQ11 User interface: Backup and synchronization setup wizard: A step-by-step wizard that guides users through setting up backup destinations (external drive, cloud storage) and synchronization options, including scheduling automatic backups.
REQ12 User interface: Help and tutorial section: A dedicated window or section accessible from the main menu, offering a searchable help database, user manual, and interactive tutorials on key features.
REQ13 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: The application must allow users to create customizable rules for automatically organizing files. These rules can be based on:
REQ14 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: File type (e.g., documents, images, music, videos).
REQ15 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: Date criteria (e.g., creation date, modification date).
REQ16 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: File name patterns (e.g., using wildcards or regular expressions).
REQ17 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: File size thresholds.
REQ18 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: Users should be able to specify the target folder structure for organized files, with options to create new folders based on rule criteria (e.g., date, project name).
REQ19 File organization requirements: Manual tagging and categorization: Users must be able to assign custom tags to files and folders manually.
REQ20 File organization requirements: Manual tagging and categorization: The application should offer a tagging interface that suggests existing tags as the user types and allows the creation of new tags.

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT>
The code provided is missing the implementation of several methods, including `update_content_view`, `update_directory_tree`, `create_new_folder`, `delete_file`, `refresh_view`, `toggle_view`, `perform_search`. These methods are essential for the functionality of the application. Additionally, there are no comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each method.

<SUGGESTION>
To fix this, you need to implement the missing methods and add comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each method. Here are some suggestions for the implementation of these methods:

1. `update_content_view`: This method should update the content view with the given list of files. You can use the `insert` method of the `content_view` Treeview widget to add the files to the view.

2. `update_directory_tree`: This method should update the directory tree with the current file system structure. You can use the `os.walk` function to iterate through the directory structure and add the directories and files to the treeview.

3. `create_new_folder`: This method should handle the logic for creating a new folder. You can use the `os.mkdir` function to create the new folder and display appropriate messages using the `messagebox` module.

4. `delete_file`: This method should handle the logic for deleting a file. You can use the `os.remove` function to delete the selected file and display appropriate messages using the `messagebox` module.

5. `refresh_view`: This method should handle the logic for refreshing the view. You need to call the `update_directory_tree` and `update_content_view` methods to update the directory tree and content view.

6. `toggle_view`: This method should handle the logic for toggling between list/grid view. You can use the `["view"]` attribute of the `content_view` Treeview widget to switch between the list and grid view.

7. `perform_search`: This method should handle the logic for performing a search. You can use the `glob.glob` function to search for files matching the query and update the content view with the search results.

Remember to add appropriate comments to each method to explain the purpose and functionality of the code.

Once you have implemented these methods and added the necessary comments, the code should be ready for further testing and refinement.

You can use the os.walk function to iterate through the directory structure and add the directories and files to the treeview.\n\n3. create_new_folder: This method should handle the logic for creating a new folder. You can use the os.mkdir function to create the new folder and display appropriate messages using the messagebox module.\n\n4. delete_file: This method should handle the logic for deleting a file. You can use the os.remove function to delete the selected file and display appropriate messages using the messagebox module.\n\n5. refresh_view: This method should handle the logic for refreshing the view. You need to call the update_directory_tree and update_content_view methods to update the directory tree and content view.\n\n6. toggle_view: This method should handle the logic for toggling between list/grid view. You can use the ["view"] attribute of the content_view Treeview widget to switch between the list and grid view.\n\n7. perform_search: This method should handle the logic for performing a search. You can use the glob.glob function to search for files matching the query and update the content view with the search results.\n\nRemember to add appropriate comments to each method to explain the purpose and functionality of the code.\n\nOnce you have implemented these methods and added the necessary comments, the code should be ready for further testing and refinement.'} |

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code provided is missing the implementation of several methods, including `update_content_view`, `update_directory_tree`, `create_new_folder`, `delete_file`, `refresh_view`, `toggle_view`, `perform_search`. These methods are essential for the functionality of the application. Additionally, there are no comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each method.

<SUGGESTION>
To fix this, you need to implement the missing methods and add comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each method. Here are some suggestions for the implementation of these methods:

1. `update_content_view`: This method should update the content view with the given list of files. You can use the `insert` method of the `content_view` Treeview widget to add the files to the view.

2. `update_directory_tree`: This method should update the directory tree with the current file system structure. You can use the `os.walk` function to iterate through the directory structure and add the directories and files to the treeview.

3. `create_new_folder`: This method should handle the logic for creating a new folder. You can use the `os.mkdir` function to create the new folder and display appropriate messages using the `messagebox` module.

4. `delete_file`: This method should handle the logic for deleting a file. You can use the `os.remove` function to delete the selected file and display appropriate messages using the `messagebox` module.

5. `refresh_view`: This method should handle the logic for refreshing the view. You need to call the `update_directory_tree` and `update_content_view` methods to update the directory tree and content view.

6. `toggle_view`: This method should handle the logic for toggling between list/grid view. You can use the `["view"]` attribute of the `content_view` Treeview widget to switch between the list and grid view.

7. `perform_search`: This method should handle the logic for performing a search. You can use the `glob.glob` function to search for files matching the query and update the content view with the search results.

Remember to add appropriate comments to each method to explain the purpose and functionality of the code.

Once you have implemented these methods and added the necessary comments, the code should be ready for further testing and refinement."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

You can use the insert method of the content_view Treeview widget to add the files to the view.\n\n2. update_directory_tree: This method should update the directory tree with the current file system structure. You can use the os.walk function to iterate through the directory structure and add the directories and files to the treeview.\n\n3. create_new_folder: This method should handle the logic for creating a new folder. You can use the os.mkdir function to create the new folder and display appropriate messages using the messagebox module.\n\n4. delete_file: This method should handle the logic for deleting a file. You can use the os.remove function to delete the selected file and display appropriate messages using the messagebox module.\n\n5. refresh_view: This method should handle the logic for refreshing the view. You need to call the update_directory_tree and update_content_view methods to update the directory tree and content view.\n\n6. toggle_view: This method should handle the logic for toggling between list/grid view. You can use the ["view"] attribute of the content_view Treeview widget to switch between the list and grid view.\n\n7. perform_search: This method should handle the logic for performing a search. You can use the glob.glob function to search for files matching the query and update the content view with the search results.\n\nRemember to add appropriate comments to each method to explain the purpose and functionality of the code.\n\nOnce you have implemented these methods and added the necessary comments, the code should be ready for further testing and refinement.'} |

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: The File Organizer and Content Manager (FOCM) is a desktop application designed to help users efficiently organize, search, and manage their local files. This software aims to enhance productivity and file management through automated organization, advanced search capabilities, and content management features. It will support various file types, including documents, images, videos, and more, providing a unified interface for managing digital content.
REQ1 User interface: Main window: The central hub of the application featuring a dual-pane layout: one pane for the directory tree (folders) and another for viewing the contents of the selected directory.
REQ2 User interface: Main window: A toolbar at the top with buttons for common actions (create new folder, delete file, refresh view, toggle between list/grid view, search bar).
REQ3 User interface: Main window: Status bar at the bottom displaying information about the selected files/folders and general statistics (total files, total size).
REQ4 User interface: Search and filter panel: A dedicated panel, accessible from the main window, allowing users to enter search criteria, choose filters (file type, date modified, size), and display results in a list or grid format.
REQ5 User interface: Search and filter panel: Advanced search options for more precise filtering, including full-text search within documents.
REQ6 User interface: File preview window: A pop-up or sidebar window that provides a quick preview of the selected file. For text documents and images, show a preview within the window. For videos and audio files, provide basic playback controls.
REQ7 User interface: File preview window: Edit mode for text files, enabling users to make quick edits directly within the preview window.
REQ8 User interface: File properties and metadata editor: A dialog box that displays when a user selects "Properties" from the context menu of a file/folder. Shows detailed information including file size, creation/modification dates, and allows the user to edit metadata tags.
REQ9 User interface: Settings/Preferences Window: A separate window accessible from the main menu, allowing users to customize application settings. This includes theme selection (dark/light), default views, file organization rules, backup settings, and extension/plugin management.
REQ10 User interface: Tag management interface: A panel or window for creating, editing, and deleting tags. Users can also assign tags to files or folders from this interface, providing a flexible way to categorize and locate files quickly.
REQ11 User interface: Backup and synchronization setup wizard: A step-by-step wizard that guides users through setting up backup destinations (external drive, cloud storage) and synchronization options, including scheduling automatic backups.
REQ12 User interface: Help and tutorial section: A dedicated window or section accessible from the main menu, offering a searchable help database, user manual, and interactive tutorials on key features.
REQ13 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: The application must allow users to create customizable rules for automatically organizing files. These rules can be based on:
REQ14 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: File type (e.g., documents, images, music, videos).
REQ15 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: Date criteria (e.g., creation date, modification date).
REQ16 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: File name patterns (e.g., using wildcards or regular expressions).
REQ17 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: File size thresholds.
REQ18 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: Users should be able to specify the target folder structure for organized files, with options to create new folders based on rule criteria (e.g., date, project name).
REQ19 File organization requirements: Manual tagging and categorization: Users must be able to assign custom tags to files and folders manually.
REQ20 File organization requirements: Manual tagging and categorization: The application should offer a tagging interface that suggests existing tags as the user types and allows the creation of new tags.
REQ21 File organization requirements: Manual tagging and categorization: Support for creating custom categories where users can group files/folders based on project, client, priority, or any other user-defined category.
REQ22 File organization requirements: Manual tagging and categorization: Users should be able to view and access files by tags and categories through a dedicated interface or filter.
REQ23 File organization requirements: Bulk file operations: The application must support bulk operations to rename, move, copy, or delete multiple files at once based on user selection.
REQ24 File organization requirements: Bulk file operations: Include options for bulk applying tags or moving files to a category, with undo functionality to revert changes if needed.
REQ25 File organization requirements: Folder and file management: Users must be able to create, rename, move, and delete files and folders from within the application..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the `update_content_view` method. This method is responsible for updating the content view with the given list of files. It should delete the existing content view items and insert new items based on the provided files. 

To fix this, you need to add the implementation of the `update_content_view` method. Here's an example of how it can be implemented:

```python
def update_content_view(self, files=None):
    '''
    Update the content view with the given list of files
    '''
    self.content_view.delete(*self.content_view.get_children())
    if files is None:
        files = []
    for file in files:
        if os.path.isdir(file):
            self.content_view.insert("", "end", text=file, tags=("folder",))
        else:
            self.content_view.insert("", "end", text=file, tags=("file",))
```

This implementation deletes all existing items in the content view and inserts new items based on the provided files. It checks if each file is a directory or a regular file and assigns the appropriate tags to the inserted item.

Please add this implementation to the `MainWindow` class to complete the code.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the `update_content_view` method. This method is responsible for updating the content view with the given list of files. It should delete the existing content view items and insert new items based on the provided files. 

To fix this, you need to add the implementation of the `update_content_view` method. Here's an example of how it can be implemented:

```python
def update_content_view(self, files=None):
    '''
    Update the content view with the given list of files
    '''
    self.content_view.delete(*self.content_view.get_children())
    if files is None:
        files = []
    for file in files:
        if os.path.isdir(file):
            self.content_view.insert("", "end", text=file, tags=("folder",))
        else:
            self.content_view.insert("", "end", text=file, tags=("file",))
```

This implementation deletes all existing items in the content view and inserts new items based on the provided files. It checks if each file is a directory or a regular file and assigns the appropriate tags to the inserted item.

Please add this implementation to the `MainWindow` class to complete the code."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

The code has been modified to include the missing `update_content_view` method. This method updates the content view with the given list of files by deleting the existing items and inserting new items based on the provided files. The tags "folder" and "file" are assigned to differentiate between directories and regular files.

Please note that this code is a starting point and may require further modifications and additions to fully implement all the requested features.

The code has been modified to include the missing `update_content_view` method. This method updates the content view with the given list of files by deleting the existing items and inserting new items based on the provided files. The tags "folder" and "file" are assigned to differentiate between directories and regular files.

Please note that this code is a starting point and may require further modifications and additions to fully implement all the requested features.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programming Language: "{language}" Ideas: "{ideas}" Codes:  "{codes}" Requirements: "{requirements}" As the {assistant_role}, by using Markdown, you should write a manual.md file which is a detailed user manual to use the software, including introducing main functions of the software, how to install environment dependencies and how to use/play it. For example: manual.md ``` LangChain Building applications with LLMs through composability Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js. Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel. Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
