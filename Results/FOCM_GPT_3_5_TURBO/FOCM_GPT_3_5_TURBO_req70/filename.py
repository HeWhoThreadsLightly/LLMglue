The code is missing the implementation of several methods, such as `create_new_folder`, `delete_file`, `refresh_view`, `toggle_view`, `perform_search`, `update_directory_tree`, `update_content_view`, and `load_icon`. These methods are essential for the functionality of the application. 
The `create_new_folder` method should handle the logic for creating a new folder. It should prompt the user for a new folder name and create the folder in the selected directory.
The `delete_file` method should handle the logic for deleting a file. It should prompt the user for confirmation before deleting the selected file.
The `refresh_view` method should update the directory tree and content view with the current file system structure.
The `toggle_view` method should switch between list and grid view in the content view.
The `perform_search` method should search for files based on the user's query and update the content view with the search results.
The `update_directory_tree` method should update the directory tree with the current file system structure.
The `update_content_view` method should update the content view with the given list of files.
The `load_icon` method should load and resize the file icons based on the file extension.
Please implement these methods and add appropriate comments to improve code clarity and maintainability.
