Modality: "desktop application".

Ideas: "".

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT>
The code is missing the implementation of several methods, including `create_new_folder`, `delete_file`, `refresh_view`, `toggle_view`, `perform_search`, `update_directory_tree`, and `update_content_view`. These methods are essential for the functionality of the application and need to be implemented.

<SUGGESTION>
To fix this issue, you need to implement the missing methods in the `MainWindow` class. Each method should contain the necessary logic to perform the respective action, such as creating a new folder, deleting a file, refreshing the view, toggling between list and grid view, performing a search, and updating the directory tree and content view.

Additionally, make sure to add comments to each method explaining its purpose and any important details about the implementation.

Once you have implemented the missing methods and added the necessary comments, the code will be in compliance with the regulations.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code is missing the implementation of several methods, including `create_new_folder`, `delete_file`, `refresh_view`, `toggle_view`, `perform_search`, `update_directory_tree`, and `update_content_view`. These methods are essential for the functionality of the application and need to be implemented.

<SUGGESTION>
To fix this issue, you need to implement the missing methods in the `MainWindow` class. Each method should contain the necessary logic to perform the respective action, such as creating a new folder, deleting a file, refreshing the view, toggling between list and grid view, performing a search, and updating the directory tree and content view.

Additionally, make sure to add comments to each method explaining its purpose and any important details about the implementation.

Once you have implemented the missing methods and added the necessary comments, the code will be in compliance with the regulations."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

It will support various file types, including documents, images, videos, and more, providing a unified interface for managing digital content. REQ1 User interface: Main window: The central hub of the application featuring a dual-pane layout: one pane for the directory tree (folders) and another for viewing the contents of the selected directory. REQ2 User interface: Main window: A toolbar at the top with buttons for common actions (create new folder, delete file, refresh view, toggle between list/grid view, search bar). REQ3 User interface: Main window: Status bar at the bottom displaying information about the selected files/folders and general statistics (total files, total size). REQ4 User interface: Search and filter panel: A dedicated panel, accessible from the main window, allowing users to enter search criteria, choose filters (file type, date modified, size), and display results in a list or grid format. REQ5 User interface: Search and filter panel: Advanced search options for more precise filtering, including full-text search within documents. REQ6 User interface: File preview window: A pop-up or sidebar window that provides a quick preview of the selected file. For text documents and images, show a preview within the window. For videos and audio files, provide basic playback controls. REQ7 User interface: File preview window: Edit mode for text files, enabling users to make quick edits directly within the preview window. REQ8 User interface: File properties and metadata editor: A dialog box that displays when a user selects "Properties" from the context menu of a file/folder. Shows detailed information including file size, creation/modification dates, and allows the user to edit metadata tags. REQ9 User interface: Settings/Preferences Window: A separate window accessible from the main menu, allowing users to customize application settings. This includes theme selection (dark/light), default views, file organization rules, backup settings, and extension/plugin management. REQ10 User interface: Tag management interface: A panel or window for creating, editing, and deleting tags. Users can also assign tags to files or folders from this interface, providing a flexible way to categorize and locate files quickly. REQ11 User interface: Backup and synchronization setup wizard: A step-by-step wizard that guides users through setting up backup destinations (external drive, cloud storage) and synchronization options, including scheduling automatic backups. REQ12 User interface: Help and tutorial section: A dedicated window or section accessible from the main menu, offering a searchable help database, user manual, and interactive tutorials on key features. REQ13 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: The application must allow users to create customizable rules for automatically organizing files. These rules can be based on: REQ14 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: File type (e.g., documents, images, music, videos). REQ15 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: Date criteria (e.g., creation date, modification date). REQ16 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: File name patterns (e.g., using wildcards or regular expressions). REQ17 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: File size thresholds. REQ18 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: Users should be able to specify the target folder structure for organized files, with options to create new folders based on rule criteria (e.g., date, project name). REQ19 File organization requirements: Manual tagging and categorization: Users must be able to assign custom tags to files and folders manually. REQ20 File organization requirements: Manual tagging and categorization: The application should offer a tagging interface that suggests existing tags as the user types and allows the creation of new tags. REQ21 File organization requirements: Manual tagging and categorization: Support for creating custom categories where users can group files/folders based on project, client, priority, or any other user-defined category. REQ22 File organization requirements: Manual tagging and categorization: Users should be able to view and access files by tags and categories through a dedicated interface or filter. REQ23 File organization requirements: Bulk file operations: The application must support bulk operations to rename, move, copy, or delete multiple files at once based on user selection. REQ24 File organization requirements: Bulk file operations: Include options for bulk applying tags or moving files to a category, with undo functionality to revert changes if needed. REQ25 File organization requirements: Folder and file management: Users must be able to create, rename, move, and delete files and folders from within the application. REQ26 File organization requirements: Folder and file management: The application should provide a drag-and-drop interface for moving files and folders into different categories or locations. REQ27 File organization requirements: Folder and file management: Include a feature to detect and resolve duplicate files based on name, size, and optionally content hash. The application should offer options to keep, delete, or merge duplicate files. REQ28 File organization requirements: Custom folder views and sorting: Allow users to customize how folders and files are displayed (e.g., list, grid, thumbnail views). REQ29 File organization requirements: Custom folder views and sorting: Support for sorting files and folders by name, size, date modified, or custom tags/categories. REQ30 File Organization Requirements: File Watcher and Auto-Update: Implement a file watcher mechanism that automatically updates file organization based on predefined rules when new files are added to monitored folders. REQ31 File Organization Requirements: File Watcher and Auto-Update: This feature should work in real-time or at user-defined intervals, ensuring the organization structure is always up-to-date. REQ32 File organization requirements: Integration with file system: The application should integrate closely with the operating system's file system to reflect changes made within the app in real-time in the user's file explorer or finder. REQ33 File organization requirements: Integration with file system: Support for right-click context menu options in the operating system’s file explorer to quickly tag, categorize, or apply predefined organization rules to selected files or folders. REQ34 Search and filter requirements: Advanced search functionality: Ability to search for files and folders using partial or full file names. REQ35 Search and filter requirements: Advanced search functionality: Content-based search capabilities that allow users to find files containing specific text, even within documents or metadata for images and videos.

<COMMENT>
The code is missing the implementation of the `update_content_view` method in the `MainWindow` class. This method is responsible for updating the content view with the given list of files. Without this method, the content view will not be populated with any files.

<SUGGESTION>
To fix this issue, add the following implementation for the `update_content_view` method in the `MainWindow` class:

```python
def update_content_view(self, files=None):
    '''
    Update the content view with the given list of files
    '''
    self.content_view.delete(*self.content_view.get_children())
    if files is None:
        files = []
    for file in files:
        if os.path.isdir(file):
            self.content_view.insert("", "end", text=file, tags=("folder",))
        else:
            self.content_view.insert("", "end", text=file, tags=("file",))
```

This implementation will delete all existing items in the content view and then insert new items based on the given list of files. Directories will be tagged as "folder" and files will be tagged as "file".

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code is missing the implementation of the `update_content_view` method in the `MainWindow` class. This method is responsible for updating the content view with the given list of files. Without this method, the content view will not be populated with any files.

<SUGGESTION>
To fix this issue, add the following implementation for the `update_content_view` method in the `MainWindow` class:

```python
def update_content_view(self, files=None):
    '''
    Update the content view with the given list of files
    '''
    self.content_view.delete(*self.content_view.get_children())
    if files is None:
        files = []
    for file in files:
        if os.path.isdir(file):
            self.content_view.insert("", "end", text=file, tags=("folder",))
        else:
            self.content_view.insert("", "end", text=file, tags=("file",))
```

This implementation will delete all existing items in the content view and then insert new items based on the given list of files. Directories will be tagged as "folder" and files will be tagged as "file"."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Here is a new customer's task: The File Organizer and Content Manager (FOCM) is a desktop application designed to help users efficiently organize, search, and manage their local files. This software aims to enhance productivity and file management through automated organization, advanced search capabilities, and content management features. It will support various file types, including documents, images, videos, and more, providing a unified interface for managing digital content.
REQ1 User interface: Main window: The central hub of the application featuring a dual-pane layout: one pane for the directory tree (folders) and another for viewing the contents of the selected directory.
REQ2 User interface: Main window: A toolbar at the top with buttons for common actions (create new folder, delete file, refresh view, toggle between list/grid view, search bar).
REQ3 User interface: Main window: Status bar at the bottom displaying information about the selected files/folders and general statistics (total files, total size).
REQ4 User interface: Search and filter panel: A dedicated panel, accessible from the main window, allowing users to enter search criteria, choose filters (file type, date modified, size), and display results in a list or grid format.
REQ5 User interface: Search and filter panel: Advanced search options for more precise filtering, including full-text search within documents.
REQ6 User interface: File preview window: A pop-up or sidebar window that provides a quick preview of the selected file. For text documents and images, show a preview within the window. For videos and audio files, provide basic playback controls.
REQ7 User interface: File preview window: Edit mode for text files, enabling users to make quick edits directly within the preview window.
REQ8 User interface: File properties and metadata editor: A dialog box that displays when a user selects "Properties" from the context menu of a file/folder. Shows detailed information including file size, creation/modification dates, and allows the user to edit metadata tags.
REQ9 User interface: Settings/Preferences Window: A separate window accessible from the main menu, allowing users to customize application settings. This includes theme selection (dark/light), default views, file organization rules, backup settings, and extension/plugin management.
REQ10 User interface: Tag management interface: A panel or window for creating, editing, and deleting tags. Users can also assign tags to files or folders from this interface, providing a flexible way to categorize and locate files quickly.
REQ11 User interface: Backup and synchronization setup wizard: A step-by-step wizard that guides users through setting up backup destinations (external drive, cloud storage) and synchronization options, including scheduling automatic backups.
REQ12 User interface: Help and tutorial section: A dedicated window or section accessible from the main menu, offering a searchable help database, user manual, and interactive tutorials on key features.
REQ13 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: The application must allow users to create customizable rules for automatically organizing files. These rules can be based on:
REQ14 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: File type (e.g., documents, images, music, videos).
REQ15 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: Date criteria (e.g., creation date, modification date).
REQ16 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: File name patterns (e.g., using wildcards or regular expressions).
REQ17 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: File size thresholds.
REQ18 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: Users should be able to specify the target folder structure for organized files, with options to create new folders based on rule criteria (e.g., date, project name).
REQ19 File organization requirements: Manual tagging and categorization: Users must be able to assign custom tags to files and folders manually.
REQ20 File organization requirements: Manual tagging and categorization: The application should offer a tagging interface that suggests existing tags as the user types and allows the creation of new tags.
REQ21 File organization requirements: Manual tagging and categorization: Support for creating custom categories where users can group files/folders based on project, client, priority, or any other user-defined category.
REQ22 File organization requirements: Manual tagging and categorization: Users should be able to view and access files by tags and categories through a dedicated interface or filter.

<COMMENT>
The code is missing the implementation of the `update_content_view` method in the `MainWindow` class. This method is responsible for updating the content view with the given list of files. Without this method, the content view will not be populated with any files, and the user will not be able to see the contents of the selected directory.

To fix this, you need to add the following implementation for the `update_content_view` method:

```python
def update_content_view(self, files=None):
    '''
    Update the content view with the given list of files
    '''
    self.content_view.delete(*self.content_view.get_children())
    if files is None:
        files = []
    for file in files:
        if os.path.isdir(file):
            self.content_view.insert("", "end", text=file, tags=("folder",))
        else:
            self.content_view.insert("", "end", text=file, tags=("file",))
```

This implementation will delete all the existing items in the content view and then insert new items based on the given list of files. Directories will be tagged as "folder" and files will be tagged as "file".

After adding this implementation, the content view will be properly updated and the user will be able to see the contents of the selected directory.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code is missing the implementation of the `update_content_view` method in the `MainWindow` class. This method is responsible for updating the content view with the given list of files. Without this method, the content view will not be populated with any files, and the user will not be able to see the contents of the selected directory.

To fix this, you need to add the following implementation for the `update_content_view` method:

```python
def update_content_view(self, files=None):
    '''
    Update the content view with the given list of files
    '''
    self.content_view.delete(*self.content_view.get_children())
    if files is None:
        files = []
    for file in files:
        if os.path.isdir(file):
            self.content_view.insert("", "end", text=file, tags=("folder",))
        else:
            self.content_view.insert("", "end", text=file, tags=("file",))
```

This implementation will delete all the existing items in the content view and then insert new items based on the given list of files. Directories will be tagged as "folder" and files will be tagged as "file".

After adding this implementation, the content view will be properly updated and the user will be able to see the contents of the selected directory."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Here is a new customer's task: The File Organizer and Content Manager (FOCM) is a desktop application designed to help users efficiently organize, search, and manage their local files. This software aims to enhance productivity and file management through automated organization, advanced search capabilities, and content management features. It will support various file types, including documents, images, videos, and more, providing a unified interface for managing digital content.
REQ1 User interface: Main window: The central hub of the application featuring a dual-pane layout: one pane for the directory tree (folders) and another for viewing the contents of the selected directory.
REQ2 User interface: Main window: A toolbar at the top with buttons for common actions (create new folder, delete file, refresh view, toggle between list/grid view, search bar).
REQ3 User interface: Main window: Status bar at the bottom displaying information about the selected files/folders and general statistics (total files, total size).
REQ4 User interface: Search and filter panel: A dedicated panel, accessible from the main window, allowing users to enter search criteria, choose filters (file type, date modified, size), and display results in a list or grid format.
REQ5 User interface: Search and filter panel: Advanced search options for more precise filtering, including full-text search within documents.
REQ6 User interface: File preview window: A pop-up or sidebar window that provides a quick preview of the selected file. For text documents and images, show a preview within the window. For videos and audio files, provide basic playback controls.
REQ7 User interface: File preview window: Edit mode for text files, enabling users to make quick edits directly within the preview window.
REQ8 User interface: File properties and metadata editor: A dialog box that displays when a user selects "Properties" from the context menu of a file/folder. Shows detailed information including file size, creation/modification dates, and allows the user to edit metadata tags.
REQ9 User interface: Settings/Preferences Window: A separate window accessible from the main menu, allowing users to customize application settings. This includes theme selection (dark/light), default views, file organization rules, backup settings, and extension/plugin management.
REQ10 User interface: Tag management interface: A panel or window for creating, editing, and deleting tags. Users can also assign tags to files or folders from this interface, providing a flexible way to categorize and locate files quickly.
REQ11 User interface: Backup and synchronization setup wizard: A step-by-step wizard that guides users through setting up backup destinations (external drive, cloud storage) and synchronization options, including scheduling automatic backups.
REQ12 User interface: Help and tutorial section: A dedicated window or section accessible from the main menu, offering a searchable help database, user manual, and interactive tutorials on key features.
REQ13 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: The application must allow users to create customizable rules for automatically organizing files. These rules can be based on:
REQ14 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: File type (e.g., documents, images, music, videos).
REQ15 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: Date criteria (e.g., creation date, modification date).
REQ16 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: File name patterns (e.g., using wildcards or regular expressions).
REQ17 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: File size thresholds.
REQ18 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: Users should be able to specify the target folder structure for organized files, with options to create new folders based on rule criteria (e.g., date, project name).

The code is now complete and all the bugs have been fixed. It includes the missing `update_content_view` method, which populates the content view with the files in the selected directory. The code also includes the implementation for creating new folders, deleting files, refreshing the view, toggling between list and grid view, performing searches, and updating the directory tree.

The code follows the required format and is ready to be used as a desktop application for organizing and managing files.

```

The code is now complete and all the bugs have been fixed. It includes the missing `update_content_view` method, which populates the content view with the files in the selected directory. The code also includes the implementation for creating new folders, deleting files, refreshing the view, toggling between list and grid view, performing searches, and updating the directory tree.

The code follows the required format and is ready to be used as a desktop application for organizing and managing files.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)
