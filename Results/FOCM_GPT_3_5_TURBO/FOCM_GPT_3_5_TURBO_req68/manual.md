Custom folder views and sorting options are available, allowing you to customize how folders and files are displayed. You can sort files and folders by name, size, date modified, or custom tags/categories.

A file watcher mechanism is implemented to automatically update file organization based on predefined rules when new files are added to monitored folders. This feature works in real-time or at user-defined intervals, ensuring that the organization structure is always up-to-date.

FOCM integrates closely with the operating system's file system to reflect changes made within the app in real-time in the user's file explorer or finder. Right-click context menu options are supported in the operating system's file explorer, allowing you to quickly tag, categorize, or apply predefined organization rules to selected files or folders.

## 11. Search and Filter

The application supports regular expressions (regex) in search queries for complex pattern matching.

Custom search filters are available to quickly select files based on common criteria such as file type, size, and modification or creation date. You can create, save, and apply custom filter sets based on any combination of file attributes, including custom tags, project names, or specific content.

Tag-based searching is integrated into FOCM, allowing you to assign custom tags to files and folders and then search for these tags. Hierarchical tags are supported to facilitate detailed organization and searching.

FOCM automatically saves recent searches for quick repetition. You can also save frequently used search queries or filters for quick access.

Search results management features are provided, including sortable search results based on various criteria such as name, size, date modified, and custom tags. You can export search results to CSV or other formats for external use. Batch operations on search results are supported, allowing you to apply actions (move, delete, tag) to multiple files at once.

Contextual actions are available in the search results, providing quick access to common file operations such as open, rename, delete, move, or edit tags. Preview options for images, documents, and videos are directly accessible from the context menu.

Smart suggestions are provided as you type in the search bar, based on your input, historical searches, and commonly accessed files. The system suggests tags, filenames, and content snippets as possible search queries.

FOCM seamlessly integrates search and filter functionality with the file organization system, allowing you to quickly organize search results into folders or tag groups directly from the search interface.
