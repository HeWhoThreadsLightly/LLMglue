3. `create_toolbar`: This method should create the toolbar with buttons for common actions in the main window.

4. `create_status_bar`: This method should create the status bar displaying information in the main window.

5. `create_new_folder`: This method should handle the logic for creating a new folder.

6. `delete_file`: This method should handle the logic for deleting a file.

7. `refresh_view`: This method should handle the logic for refreshing the view.

8. `toggle_view`: This method should handle the logic for toggling between list and grid view.

9. `perform_search`: This method should handle the logic for performing a search.

10. `update_directory_tree`: This method should update the directory tree with the current file system structure.

11. `update_content_view`: This method should update the content view with the given list of files.

12. `load_icon`: This method should load and resize the file icons.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the code is missing the implementation of the `MainWindow` class methods. These methods are necessary for the functionality of the application. 

To fix this, you need to implement the following methods in the `MainWindow` class:

1. `create_directory_tree`: This method should create the directory tree pane in the main window and update it with the current file system structure.

2. `create_content_view`: This method should create the content view pane in the main window.

3. `create_toolbar`: This method should create the toolbar with buttons for common actions in the main window.

4. `create_status_bar`: This method should create the status bar displaying information in the main window.

5. `create_new_folder`: This method should handle the logic for creating a new folder.

6. `delete_file`: This method should handle the logic for deleting a file.

7. `refresh_view`: This method should handle the logic for refreshing the view.

8. `toggle_view`: This method should handle the logic for toggling between list and grid view.

9. `perform_search`: This method should handle the logic for performing a search.

10. `update_directory_tree`: This method should update the directory tree with the current file system structure.

11. `update_content_view`: This method should update the content view with the given list of files.

12. `load_icon`: This method should load and resize the file icons.

Please implement these methods according to the requirements and provide any necessary comments within the code."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

These methods are essential for the functionality of the application and need to be implemented.

<SUGGESTION> To fix this issue, you need to implement the missing methods in the code. Each method should have the necessary logic to perform its intended functionality, such as creating the directory tree, updating the content view, handling file operations, and loading icons. Make sure to include the necessary comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each method.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of several methods, such as `create_directory_tree`, `create_content_view`, `create_toolbar`, `create_status_bar`, `create_new_folder`, `delete_file`, `refresh_view`, `toggle_view`, `perform_search`, `update_directory_tree`, `update_content_view`, and `load_icon`. These methods are essential for the functionality of the application and need to be implemented.

<SUGGESTION> To fix this issue, you need to implement the missing methods in the code. Each method should have the necessary logic to perform its intended functionality, such as creating the directory tree, updating the content view, handling file operations, and loading icons. Make sure to include the necessary comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each method."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the implementation of the `update_content_view` method in the `MainWindow` class. Currently, the method is not correctly handling the display of file icons in the content view.

In the `update_content_view` method, the `icon` variable is being used to store the resized icon image, but it is not being assigned to the `image` attribute of the `Treeview` widget. As a result, the file icons are not being displayed in the content view.

To fix this issue, you need to assign the `icon` variable to the `image` attribute of the `Treeview` widget for each file item. You can do this by modifying the line `self.content_view.insert("", "end", text=file, image=icon, tags=("file",))` to `self.content_view.insert("", "end", text=file, image=icon, tags=("file",), image=icon)`.

Here is the revised code for the `update_content_view` method:

```python
def update_content_view(self, files=None):
    '''
    Update the content view with the given list of files
    '''
    self.content_view.delete(*self.content_view.get_children())
    if files is None:
        files = []
    for file in files:
        if os.path.isdir(file):
            self.content_view.insert("", "end", text=file, tags=("folder",))
        else:
            file_name, file_ext = os.path.splitext(file)
            icon_path = get_file_icon(file_ext.lower())
            icon = self.load_icon(icon_path, (16, 16))
            self.content_view.insert("", "end", text=file, image=icon, tags=("file",), image=icon)
    self.content_view.tag_configure("file", image=icon)  # Apply the icon to all file tags
```

Please make this modification to ensure that the file icons are displayed correctly in the content view.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the implementation of the `update_content_view` method in the `MainWindow` class. Currently, the method is not correctly handling the display of file icons in the content view.

In the `update_content_view` method, the `icon` variable is being used to store the resized icon image, but it is not being assigned to the `image` attribute of the `Treeview` widget. As a result, the file icons are not being displayed in the content view.

To fix this issue, you need to assign the `icon` variable to the `image` attribute of the `Treeview` widget for each file item. You can do this by modifying the line `self.content_view.insert("", "end", text=file, image=icon, tags=("file",))` to `self.content_view.insert("", "end", text=file, image=icon, tags=("file",), image=icon)`.

Here is the revised code for the `update_content_view` method:

```python
def update_content_view(self, files=None):
    '''
    Update the content view with the given list of files
    '''
    self.content_view.delete(*self.content_view.get_children())
    if files is None:
        files = []
    for file in files:
        if os.path.isdir(file):
            self.content_view.insert("", "end", text=file, tags=("folder",))
        else:
            file_name, file_ext = os.path.splitext(file)
            icon_path = get_file_icon(file_ext.lower())
            icon = self.load_icon(icon_path, (16, 16))
            self.content_view.insert("", "end", text=file, image=icon, tags=("file",), image=icon)
    self.content_view.tag_configure("file", image=icon)  # Apply the icon to all file tags
```

Please make this modification to ensure that the file icons are displayed correctly in the content view."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

A file watcher mechanism is implemented to automatically update file organization based on predefined rules when new files are added to monitored folders. This feature works in real-time or at user-defined intervals, ensuring that the organization structure is always up-to-date.

FOCM integrates closely with the operating system's file system to reflect changes made within the app in real-time in the user's file explorer or finder. Right-click context menu options are supported in the operating system's file explorer, allowing you to quickly tag, categorize, or apply predefined organization rules to selected files or folders.

## 11. Search and Filter
