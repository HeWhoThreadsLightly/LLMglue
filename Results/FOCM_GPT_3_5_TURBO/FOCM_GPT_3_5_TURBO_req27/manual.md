## Main Window

The main window of the File Organizer and Content Manager serves as the central hub of the application. It features a dual-pane layout, with one pane for the directory tree (folders) and another for viewing the contents of the selected directory.

### Toolbar

At the top of the main window, you will find a toolbar with buttons for common actions. These buttons allow you to create a new folder, delete a file, refresh the view, toggle between list/grid view, and perform a search.

### Status Bar

The bottom of the main window displays a status bar that provides information about the selected files/folders and general statistics, such as the total number of files and total size.

## Search and Filter Panel

The File Organizer and Content Manager provides a dedicated panel for searching and filtering files. This panel is accessible from the main window and allows you to enter search criteria, choose filters (file type, date modified, size), and display the results in a list or grid format.

Advanced search options are available for more precise filtering, including full-text search within documents.

## File Preview Window

When you select a file in the main window, the File Organizer and Content Manager provides a file preview window. This window can be displayed as a pop-up or sidebar and provides a quick preview of the selected file. For text documents and images, the preview is shown within the window. For videos and audio files, basic playback controls are available.

Text files can also be edited directly within the preview window, enabling users to make quick edits without opening a separate editor.

## File Properties and Metadata Editor

The File Organizer and Content Manager allows users to view and edit file properties and metadata. When you select a file or folder and right-click to open the context menu, you can choose "Properties" to open a dialog box that displays detailed information about the file, including file size, creation/modification dates, and metadata tags. You can edit the metadata tags directly in this dialog box.

## Settings/Preferences Window

The File Organizer and Content Manager provides a separate window accessible from the main menu for customizing application settings. In this window, you can customize the theme (dark/light), default views, file organization rules, backup settings, and extension/plugin management.

## Tag Management Interface

To provide a flexible way to categorize and locate files quickly, the File Organizer and Content Manager offers a tag management interface. This interface allows you to create, edit, and delete tags. You can also assign tags to files or folders directly from this interface.

## Backup and Synchronization Setup Wizard

The File Organizer and Content Manager includes a step-by-step wizard that guides users through setting up backup destinations (external drive, cloud storage) and synchronization options. This wizard allows you to schedule automatic backups and provides options for configuring backup settings.

## Help and Tutorial Section

To assist users in understanding and using the File Organizer and Content Manager, a dedicated help and tutorial section is accessible from the main menu. This section offers a searchable help database, user manual, and interactive tutorials on key features.

## File Organization

The File Organizer and Content Manager provides both automated and manual file organization features to help users manage their files effectively.

### Automated Organization Rules

Users can create customizable rules for automatically organizing files based on various criteria, including file type, date criteria (creation date, modification date), file name patterns (using wildcards or regular expressions), and file size thresholds. Users can specify the target folder structure for organized files and have the option to create new folders based on rule criteria, such as date or project name.

### Manual Tagging and Categorization

Users can manually assign custom tags to files and folders to categorize them. The File Organizer and Content Manager offers a tagging interface that suggests existing tags as the user types and allows the creation of new tags. Users can also create custom categories to group files/folders based on project, client, priority, or any other user-defined category. Files can be viewed and accessed by tags and categories through a dedicated interface or filter.

### Bulk File Operations

The File Organizer and Content Manager supports bulk operations for renaming, moving, copying, or deleting multiple files at once based on user selection. Users can also apply tags or move files to a category in bulk. The application provides an undo functionality to revert changes if needed.

### Folder and File Management

Users can create, rename, move, and delete files and folders directly from within the application. The File Organizer and Content Manager provides a drag-and-drop interface for moving files and folders into different categories or locations.

### Duplicate File Detection and Resolution

The File Organizer and Content Manager includes a feature to detect and resolve duplicate files based on name, size, and optionally content hash. Users can choose to keep, delete, or merge duplicate files based on their preferences.
