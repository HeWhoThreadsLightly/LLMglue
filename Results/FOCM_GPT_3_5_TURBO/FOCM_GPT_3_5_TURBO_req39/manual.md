## File Organization

The File Organizer and Content Manager provides various features for file organization.

### Automated Organization Rules

Users can create customizable rules for automatically organizing files based on file type, date criteria (creation date, modification date), file name patterns (using wildcards or regular expressions), and file size thresholds. Users can specify the target folder structure for organized files, with options to create new folders based on rule criteria (e.g., date, project name).

### Manual Tagging and Categorization

Users can assign custom tags to files and folders manually. The application offers a tagging interface that suggests existing tags as the user types and allows the creation of new tags.

Users can view and access files by tags and categories through a dedicated interface or filter.

The application provides a drag-and-drop interface for moving files and folders into different categories or locations. It also includes a feature to detect and resolve duplicate files based on name, size, and optionally content hash. Users can choose to keep, delete, or merge duplicate files.

The application provides predefined filters to quickly select files based on common criteria such as file type, size, and modification or creation date. Users can also create, save, and apply custom filter sets based on any combination of file attributes, including custom tags, project names, or specific content.
