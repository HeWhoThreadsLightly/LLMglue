Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of several methods, such as `update_content_view`, `perform_search`, `toggle_view`, `refresh_view`, `delete_file`, `create_new_folder`, `create_status_bar`, `create_toolbar`, `create_content_view`, and `create_directory_tree`. These methods are essential for the functionality of the application. Additionally, the code lacks necessary comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each method. Please implement these methods and add appropriate comments to improve code readability and maintainability."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The code provided is missing the implementation of several methods, including the methods for creating the file preview window, file properties and metadata editor, settings/preferences window, tag management interface, backup and synchronization setup wizard, help and tutorial section, and the methods for handling bulk file operations, folder and file management, and search and filter functionality. 

To fix this, you need to implement these missing methods and ensure that they fulfill the corresponding requirements specified in the task. Additionally, you should add necessary comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each method."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: To specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly, you can create a requirements.txt file with the following content:
requirements.txt
```
tkinter==8.6
Pillow==8.3.2
```
In this case, the project requires the `tkinter` package for creating the graphical user interface and the `Pillow` package for image processing and preview capabilities. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel. Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Full functionality is accessible via keyboard shortcuts, allowing users who cannot use a mouse to navigate efficiently through the application. Tab navigation is implemented through all interactive elements in a logical order. Visual indicators are provided for the currently focused element.

### Screen Reader Support

The application makes use of alt text to describe images, icons, and other non-textual elements. Labels and roles are used for complex elements (like drag-and-drop interfaces or custom controls) to ensure their purpose and state are conveyed to screen reader users.

### High Contrast Mode

The File Organizer and Content Manager supports high contrast themes that make text, icons, and other elements more distinguishable for users with low vision. All text is readable, and all interactive elements are visible against background colors.
