Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of several methods, such as `create_directory_tree`, `create_content_view`, `create_toolbar`, `create_status_bar`, `create_new_folder`, `delete_file`, `refresh_view`, `toggle_view`, `perform_search`, `update_directory_tree`, and `update_content_view`. These methods are essential for the functionality of the application. 

<SUGGESTION> To fix this, you need to implement these methods by adding the necessary code to perform the intended actions. Additionally, make sure to add comments to each method explaining their purpose and functionality."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of several methods, such as `create_directory_tree`, `create_content_view`, `create_toolbar`, `create_status_bar`, `create_new_folder`, `delete_file`, `refresh_view`, `toggle_view`, `perform_search`, `update_directory_tree`, `update_content_view`. These methods are essential for the functionality of the application. 

<SUGGESTION> To fix this, you need to implement the missing methods and add the necessary code inside each method to fulfill the corresponding functionality. Make sure to include the required logic and GUI elements to meet the requirements specified by the user."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

<COMMENT>
The code is missing the implementation of the `update_content_view` method in the `MainWindow` class. This method is responsible for updating the content view with the given list of files. Without this method, the content view will not be populated with the files.

<SUGGESTION>
To fix this issue, add the following implementation for the `update_content_view` method in the `MainWindow` class:

```python
def update_content_view(self, files=None):
    '''
    Update the content view with the given list of files
    '''
    self.content_view.delete(*self.content_view.get_children())
    if files is None:
        files = []
    for file in files:
        if os.path.isdir(file):
            self.content_view.insert("", "end", text=file, tags=("folder",))
        else:
            self.content_view.insert("", "end", text=file, tags=("file",))
```

This implementation will delete all existing items in the content view and then insert new items based on the given list of files. Directories will be tagged as "folder" and files will be tagged as "file".

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code is missing the implementation of the `update_content_view` method in the `MainWindow` class. This method is responsible for updating the content view with the given list of files. Without this method, the content view will not be populated with the files.

<SUGGESTION>
To fix this issue, add the following implementation for the `update_content_view` method in the `MainWindow` class:

```python
def update_content_view(self, files=None):
    '''
    Update the content view with the given list of files
    '''
    self.content_view.delete(*self.content_view.get_children())
    if files is None:
        files = []
    for file in files:
        if os.path.isdir(file):
            self.content_view.insert("", "end", text=file, tags=("folder",))
        else:
            self.content_view.insert("", "end", text=file, tags=("file",))
```

This implementation will delete all existing items in the content view and then insert new items based on the given list of files. Directories will be tagged as "folder" and files will be tagged as "file"."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

For example: manual.md ``` LangChain Building applications with LLMs through composability Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js. Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel. Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
