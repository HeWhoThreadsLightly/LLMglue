You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new customer's task: The File Organizer and Content Manager (FOCM) is a desktop application designed to help users efficiently organize, search, and manage their local files. This software aims to enhance productivity and file management through automated organization, advanced search capabilities, and content management features. It will support various file types, including documents, images, videos, and more, providing a unified interface for managing digital content.
REQ1 User interface: Main window: The central hub of the application featuring a dual-pane layout: one pane for the directory tree (folders) and another for viewing the contents of the selected directory.
REQ2 User interface: Main window: A toolbar at the top with buttons for common actions (create new folder, delete file, refresh view, toggle between list/grid view, search bar).
REQ3 User interface: Main window: Status bar at the bottom displaying information about the selected files/folders and general statistics (total files, total size).
REQ4 User interface: Search and filter panel: A dedicated panel, accessible from the main window, allowing users to enter search criteria, choose filters (file type, date modified, size), and display results in a list or grid format.
REQ5 User interface: Search and filter panel: Advanced search options for more precise filtering, including full-text search within documents.
REQ6 User interface: File preview window: A pop-up or sidebar window that provides a quick preview of the selected file. For text documents and images, show a preview within the window. For videos and audio files, provide basic playback controls..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

<Comment>
The code is missing the necessary import statements for the classes used in the MainWindow class. Specifically, the ttk module is imported, but the Treeview and Label classes from ttk are not imported. To fix this, add the necessary import statements for Treeview and Label.

<Suggestion>
Add the following import statements at the beginning of the main.py file:
```python
from tkinter import ttk
from tkinter.ttk import Treeview, Label
```

This will ensure that the Treeview and Label classes are properly imported and can be used in the MainWindow class.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The code is missing the necessary import statements for the classes used in the MainWindow class. Specifically, the ttk module is imported, but the Treeview and Label classes from ttk are not imported. To fix this, add the necessary import statements for Treeview and Label.

<Suggestion>
Add the following import statements at the beginning of the main.py file:
```python
from tkinter import ttk
from tkinter.ttk import Treeview, Label
```

This will ensure that the Treeview and Label classes are properly imported and can be used in the MainWindow class."

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<Comment>
The code is missing the necessary imports for the Treeview and Label classes from the tkinter.ttk module. To fix this, add the following import statements at the top of the main.py file:

```python
from tkinter.ttk import Treeview, Label
```

This will ensure that the Treeview and Label classes are available for use in the code.

Once you have made this change, the code should be able to run without any import errors.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The code is missing the necessary imports for the Treeview and Label classes from the tkinter.ttk module. To fix this, add the following import statements at the top of the main.py file:

```python
from tkinter.ttk import Treeview, Label
```

This will ensure that the Treeview and Label classes are available for use in the code.

Once you have made this change, the code should be able to run without any import errors."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: The File Organizer and Content Manager (FOCM) is a desktop application designed to help users efficiently organize, search, and manage their local files. This software aims to enhance productivity and file management through automated organization, advanced search capabilities, and content management features. It will support various file types, including documents, images, videos, and more, providing a unified interface for managing digital content.

REQ2 User interface: Main window: A toolbar at the top with buttons for common actions (create new folder, delete file, refresh view, toggle between list/grid view, search bar).
REQ3 User interface: Main window: Status bar at the bottom displaying information about the selected files/folders and general statistics (total files, total size).
REQ4 User interface: Search and filter panel: A dedicated panel, accessible from the main window, allowing users to enter search criteria, choose filters (file type, date modified, size), and display results in a list or grid format.
REQ5 User interface: Search and filter panel: Advanced search options for more precise filtering, including full-text search within documents.
REQ6 User interface: File preview window: A pop-up or sidebar window that provides a quick preview of the selected file. For text documents and images, show a preview within the window. For videos and audio files, provide basic playback controls..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary import statements for the Treeview and Label classes from the tkinter.ttk module. These classes are used in the create_directory_tree and create_status_bar methods, respectively. To fix this, add the following import statements at the beginning of the main.py file:

```python
from tkinter.ttk import Treeview, Label
```

This will ensure that the required classes are imported and available for use in the code.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary import statements for the Treeview and Label classes from the tkinter.ttk module. These classes are used in the create_directory_tree and create_status_bar methods, respectively. To fix this, add the following import statements at the beginning of the main.py file:

```python
from tkinter.ttk import Treeview, Label
```

This will ensure that the required classes are imported and available for use in the code."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
