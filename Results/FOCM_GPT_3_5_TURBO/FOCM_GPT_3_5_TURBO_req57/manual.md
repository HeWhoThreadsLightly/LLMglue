The toolbar at the top provides buttons for common actions such as creating a new folder, deleting a file, refreshing the view, toggling between list/grid view, and a search bar for performing searches. The status bar at the bottom displays information about the selected files/folders and general statistics.

### 2. Search and Filter

FOCM provides a dedicated panel for entering search criteria, choosing filters (file type, date modified, size), and displaying results in a list or grid format. Advanced search options are available for more precise filtering, including full-text search within documents. The software also offers support for regular expressions (regex) in search queries for complex pattern matching.

### 3. File Preview

FOCM allows you to quickly preview selected files using a pop-up or sidebar window. For text documents and images, a preview is shown within the window. For videos and audio files, basic playback controls are provided. You can also edit text files directly within the preview window.

FOCM includes a file properties and metadata editor that displays detailed information about a selected file or folder, including file size, creation/modification dates. You can also edit metadata tags using this editor.

### 5. Settings/Preferences
