<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary import statements for the classes used in the application. Specifically, the `messagebox` class from the `tkinter` module is not imported. To fix this, add the following import statement at the beginning of the `main.py` file:

```python
from tkinter import messagebox
```

This will ensure that the `messagebox` class is available for displaying message boxes in the application.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary import statements for the classes used in the application. Specifically, the `messagebox` class from the `tkinter` module is not imported. To fix this, add the following import statement at the beginning of the `main.py` file:

```python

This will ensure that the `messagebox` class is available for displaying message boxes in the application."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary import statements for the classes used in the application. Specifically, the `messagebox` class from the `tkinter` module is not imported. To fix this, add the following import statement at the beginning of the `main.py` file:

```python
from tkinter import messagebox
```

This will ensure that the `messagebox` class is available for displaying message boxes in the application."

As the comment suggests, add the following import statement at the beginning of the `main.py` file:

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary imports for the referenced classes and modules. Specifically, the `messagebox` module is not imported in the `main.py` file. To fix this, add the following import statement at the top of the `main.py` file:

```python
from tkinter import messagebox
```

Once you have made this change, the code will be able to use the `messagebox` module for displaying information to the user.

After making this change, the code will be in compliance with regulation 1.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary imports for the referenced classes and modules. Specifically, the `messagebox` module is not imported in the `main.py` file. To fix this, add the following import statement at the top of the `main.py` file:

```python
from tkinter import messagebox
```

Once you have made this change, the code will be able to use the `messagebox` module for displaying information to the user.

After making this change, the code will be in compliance with regulation 1."

As the Programmer, I have fixed the missing import statement for the `messagebox` module. Here is the updated code:

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary imports for the referenced classes and modules. Specifically, the `messagebox` module is not imported. To fix this, add the following import statement at the beginning of the `main.py` file:

```python
from tkinter import messagebox

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary imports for the referenced classes and modules. Specifically, the `messagebox` module is not imported. To fix this, add the following import statement at the beginning of the `main.py` file:

```python

```

Once you've made this change, the code should be ready for further review."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
