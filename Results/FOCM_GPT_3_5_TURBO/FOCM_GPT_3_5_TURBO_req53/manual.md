## Features

The File Organizer and Content Manager provides a wide range of features to help you efficiently manage your files. Here are some of the key features:

1. Automated Organization Rules: You can create customizable rules for automatically organizing files based on file type, date criteria, file name patterns, and file size thresholds. You can specify the target folder structure for organized files, including options to create new folders based on rule criteria.

2. Manual Tagging and Categorization: You can assign custom tags to files and folders manually. The application offers a tagging interface that suggests existing tags as you type and allows the creation of new tags. You can also create custom categories to group files/folders based on project, client, priority, or any other user-defined category.

3. Bulk File Operations: The application supports bulk operations to rename, move, copy, or delete multiple files at once based on your selection. You can also bulk apply tags or move files to a category, with undo functionality to revert changes if needed.

4. Folder and File Management: You can create, rename, move, and delete files and folders from within the application. The application provides a drag-and-drop interface for moving files and folders into different categories or locations. It also includes a feature to detect and resolve duplicate files based on name, size, and optionally content hash.

5. Custom Folder Views and Sorting: You can customize how folders and files are displayed, including list, grid, and thumbnail views. The application supports sorting files and folders by name, size, date modified, or custom tags/categories.

6. File Watcher and Auto-Update: The application implements a file watcher mechanism that automatically updates file organization based on predefined rules when new files are added to monitored folders. This feature works in real-time or at user-defined intervals, ensuring the organization structure is always up-to-date.

7. Integration with File System: The application integrates closely with the operating system's file system to reflect changes made within the app in real-time in the user's file explorer or finder. It also supports right-click context menu options in the operating system's file explorer to quickly tag, categorize, or apply predefined organization rules to selected files or folders.

8. Advanced Search Functionality: The application provides advanced search capabilities, including the ability to search for files and folders using partial or full file names. It also supports content-based search capabilities to find files containing specific text, even within documents or metadata for images and videos. You can use regular expressions (regex) in search queries for complex pattern matching.

9. Custom Search Filters: The application offers predefined filters to quickly select files based on common criteria such as file type, size, and modification or creation date. You can also create, save, and apply custom filter sets based on any combination of file attributes, including custom tags, project names, or specific content.

10. Tag-Based Searching: The application integrates a tagging system where you can assign custom tags to files and folders and then search for these tags. It supports hierarchical tags to facilitate detailed organization and searching.

11. Search History and Saved Searches: The application automatically saves recent searches for quick repetition. You can also save frequently used search queries or filters for quick access.

12. Search Results Management: You can sort search results based on various criteria such as name, size, date modified, and custom tags. The application provides options to export search results to CSV or other formats for external use. You can perform batch operations on search results, allowing you to apply actions (move, delete, tag) to multiple files at once. Contextual actions are available in the search results context menu for quick file operations.

13. Smart Suggestions: As you type in the search bar, the application offers smart suggestions based on your input, historical searches, and commonly accessed files. It suggests tags, filenames, and content snippets as possible search queries.
