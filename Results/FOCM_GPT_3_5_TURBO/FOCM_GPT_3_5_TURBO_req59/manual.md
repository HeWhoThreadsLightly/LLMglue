## Main Window

The main window of FOCM serves as the central hub for managing your files. It features a dual-pane layout, with one pane for the directory tree (folders) and another for viewing the contents of the selected directory.

### Directory Tree

The directory tree pane displays the file system structure of your computer. You can navigate through folders by expanding and collapsing the tree nodes. To select a folder, simply click on it.

### Content View

The content view pane shows the files and folders within the selected directory. You can view the files in either list or grid view, depending on your preference. To switch between views, click on the "Toggle View" button in the toolbar.

### Toolbar

The toolbar at the top of the main window provides quick access to common actions. Here are the available buttons:

- **New Folder**: Click this button to create a new folder in the current directory.
- **Delete File**: Use this button to delete the selected file.
- **Refresh View**: Click this button to refresh the content view and update it with any changes made to the file system.
- **Toggle View**: This button toggles between list and grid view in the content view.
- **Search Bar**: Enter search criteria in the search bar and click the "Search" button to perform a search.

### Status Bar

The status bar at the bottom of the main window displays information about the selected files and folders, as well as general statistics such as the total number of files and total size.

## Search and Filter Panel

FOCM provides a dedicated search and filter panel that allows you to search for files based on various criteria and apply filters to narrow down the results.

To access the search and filter panel, click on the "Search" button in the toolbar. The panel will appear on the screen, allowing you to enter search criteria, choose filters (file type, date modified, size), and display the results in a list or grid format.

### Advanced Search Options

FOCM offers advanced search options for more precise filtering. You can perform full-text search within documents, enabling you to find files containing specific text. Additionally, you can use regular expressions (regex) in search queries for complex pattern matching.

### Custom Search Filters

In addition to the predefined filters provided by FOCM, you can create your own custom filters based on any combination of file attributes. This includes custom tags, project names, or specific content. Custom filters can be saved and applied for quick access in the future.

## File Preview Window

FOCM allows you to preview files before opening or editing them. When you select a file in the content view, a file preview window will appear as a pop-up or sidebar. The preview window provides a quick preview of the selected file, with different features depending on the file type:

- For text documents and images, the preview window will display the content of the file.
- For videos and audio files, basic playback controls will be available.

For text files, you can also enter edit mode directly within the preview window to make quick edits.

## File Properties and Metadata Editor

FOCM provides a file properties and metadata editor that allows you to view and edit detailed information about a file or folder. To access the file properties dialog box, right-click on a file or folder and select "Properties" from the context menu.

The file properties dialog box displays information such as file size, creation/modification dates, and metadata tags. You can edit the metadata tags directly within the dialog box.
