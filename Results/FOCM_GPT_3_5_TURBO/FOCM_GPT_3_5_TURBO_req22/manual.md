## File Organization

FOCM provides both automated organization rules and manual tagging and categorization features to help users organize their files effectively.

### Automated Organization Rules

FOCM allows users to create customizable rules for automatically organizing files based on various criteria:

- File type (e.g., documents, images, music, videos)
- Date criteria (e.g., creation date, modification date)
- File name patterns (e.g., using wildcards or regular expressions)
- File size thresholds

Users can specify the target folder structure for organized files and choose options to create new folders based on rule criteria such as date or project name.

### Manual Tagging and Categorization

FOCM allows users to assign custom tags to files and folders manually. The application offers a tagging interface that suggests existing tags as the user types and allows the creation of new tags. Users can also create custom categories to group files/folders based on project, client, priority, or any other user-defined category. Files can be viewed and accessed by tags and categories through a dedicated interface or filter.

## Backup and Synchronization

FOCM includes a backup and synchronization feature to help users protect their files and keep them in sync across different storage locations. The backup and synchronization setup wizard guides users through the process of setting up backup destinations (external drive, cloud storage) and configuring synchronization options, including scheduling automatic backups.
