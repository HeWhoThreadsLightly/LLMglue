## User Interface

FOCM provides a user-friendly interface with several key components:

### Main Window

The main window is the central hub of the application. It features a dual-pane layout, with one pane for the directory tree (folders) and another for viewing the contents of the selected directory. You can navigate through your file system by expanding and collapsing folders in the directory tree.

### Toolbar

The toolbar at the top of the main window provides buttons for common actions, including creating a new folder, deleting a file, refreshing the view, toggling between list/grid view, and a search bar for searching files.

### Status Bar

The status bar at the bottom of the main window displays information about the selected files/folders and general statistics, such as the total number of files and total size.

### Search and Filter Panel

The search and filter panel is a dedicated panel accessible from the main window. It allows you to enter search criteria, choose filters (file type, date modified, size), and display the results in a list or grid format. Advanced search options are available for more precise filtering, including full-text search within documents.

### File Preview Window

The file preview window is a pop-up or sidebar window that provides a quick preview of the selected file. For text documents and images, it shows a preview within the window. For videos and audio files, it provides basic playback controls. Text files can also be edited directly within the preview window.

### File Properties and Metadata Editor

The file properties and metadata editor is a dialog box that displays when you select "Properties" from the context menu of a file/folder. It shows detailed information about the file, including file size, creation/modification dates, and allows you to edit metadata tags.

### Settings/Preferences Window

The settings/preferences window is a separate window accessible from the main menu. It allows you to customize application settings, including theme selection (dark/light), default views, file organization rules, backup settings, and extension/plugin management.

### Tag Management Interface

The tag management interface is a panel or window for creating, editing, and deleting tags. You can assign tags to files or folders from this interface, providing a flexible way to categorize and locate files quickly.

### Backup and Synchronization Setup Wizard

The backup and synchronization setup wizard is a step-by-step wizard that guides you through setting up backup destinations (external drive, cloud storage) and synchronization options, including scheduling automatic backups.

### Help and Tutorial Section

The help and tutorial section is a dedicated window or section accessible from the main menu. It offers a searchable help database, user manual, and interactive tutorials on key features.

## File Organization

FOCM provides powerful file organization features to help you keep your files organized and easily accessible.

### Automated Organization Rules

FOCM allows you to create customizable rules for automatically organizing files. These rules can be based on file type, date criteria (creation date, modification date), file name patterns (using wildcards or regular expressions), and file size thresholds. You can specify the target folder structure for organized files, with options to create new folders based on rule criteria (e.g., date, project name).

### Manual Tagging and Categorization

You can assign custom tags to files and folders manually. FOCM offers a tagging interface that suggests existing tags as you type and allows the creation of new tags. It also supports creating custom categories where you can group files/folders based on project, client, priority, or any other user-defined category. You can view and access files by tags and categories through a dedicated interface or filter.

### Bulk File Operations

FOCM supports bulk operations to rename, move, copy, or delete multiple files at once based on your selection. You can also bulk apply tags or move files to a category. The application provides an undo functionality to revert changes if needed.

### Folder and File Management

You can create, rename, move, and delete files and folders from within the application. FOCM provides a drag-and-drop interface for moving files and folders into different categories or locations. It also includes a feature to detect and resolve duplicate files based on name, size, and optionally content hash. You can choose to keep, delete, or merge duplicate files.

### Custom Folder Views and Sorting

FOCM allows you to customize how folders and files are displayed. You can choose between list, grid, and thumbnail views. It also supports sorting files and folders by name, size, date modified, or custom tags/categories.

### File Watcher and Auto-Update

FOCM implements a file watcher mechanism that automatically updates file organization based on predefined rules when new files are added to monitored folders. This feature works in real-time or at user-defined intervals, ensuring that the organization structure is always up-to-date.
