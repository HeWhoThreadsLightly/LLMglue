## Main Window

The main window is the central hub of the FOCM application. It features a dual-pane layout, with one pane for the directory tree (folders) and another for viewing the contents of the selected directory.

### Toolbar

The toolbar at the top of the main window provides buttons for common actions:

- **Create New Folder**: Click this button to create a new folder in the selected directory.
- **Delete File**: Click this button to delete the selected file.
- **Refresh View**: Click this button to refresh the view and update the directory tree and content view.
- **Toggle View**: Click this button to toggle between list and grid view.
- **Search Bar**: Enter search criteria in the search bar and click the search button to perform a search.

### Status Bar

The status bar at the bottom of the main window displays information about the selected files/folders and general statistics, such as the total number of files and total size.

## Search and Filter Panel

The search and filter panel is a dedicated panel accessible from the main window. It allows users to enter search criteria, choose filters (file type, date modified, size), and display results in a list or grid format.

### Advanced Search Options

The search and filter panel also provides advanced search options for more precise filtering. This includes full-text search within documents, allowing you to search for specific keywords or phrases within the content of your files.

## File Preview Window

The file preview window is a pop-up or sidebar window that provides a quick preview of the selected file. For text documents and images, the preview is shown within the window. For videos and audio files, basic playback controls are provided.

### Edit Mode

For text files, the file preview window also includes an edit mode, enabling users to make quick edits directly within the preview window. This allows you to make changes to your files without opening them in a separate editor.

## File Properties and Metadata Editor

The file properties and metadata editor is a dialog box that displays when a user selects "Properties" from the context menu of a file/folder. It shows detailed information about the file, including file size, creation/modification dates, and allows the user to edit metadata tags.

## Settings/Preferences Window

The settings/preferences window is a separate window accessible from the main menu. It allows users to customize application settings, including theme selection (dark/light), default views, file organization rules, backup settings, and extension/plugin management.

## Tag Management Interface

The tag management interface is a panel or window for creating, editing, and deleting tags. Users can also assign tags to files or folders from this interface, providing a flexible way to categorize and locate files quickly.
