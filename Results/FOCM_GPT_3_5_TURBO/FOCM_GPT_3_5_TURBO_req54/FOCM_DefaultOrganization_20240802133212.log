<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of several methods, such as `create_directory_tree`, `create_content_view`, `create_toolbar`, `create_status_bar`, `create_new_folder`, `delete_file`, `refresh_view`, `toggle_view`, `perform_search`, `update_directory_tree`, and `update_content_view`. These methods are essential for the functionality of the application. 

<SUGGESTION> To fix this issue, you need to implement these methods by adding the necessary code to perform the intended actions. For example, in the `create_directory_tree` method, you can use the `os.walk` function to traverse the file system and populate the directory tree. Similarly, in the `create_content_view` method, you can use the `glob` module to search for files matching the given query and display them in the content view. 

Once you have implemented these methods, make sure to test the application thoroughly to ensure that all the required features are working correctly.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of several methods, such as `create_directory_tree`, `create_content_view`, `create_toolbar`, `create_status_bar`, `create_new_folder`, `delete_file`, `refresh_view`, `toggle_view`, `perform_search`, `update_directory_tree`, and `update_content_view`. These methods are essential for the functionality of the application. 

<SUGGESTION> To fix this issue, you need to implement these methods by adding the necessary code to perform the intended actions. For example, in the `create_directory_tree` method, you can use the `os.walk` function to traverse the file system and populate the directory tree. Similarly, in the `create_content_view` method, you can use the `glob` module to search for files matching the given query and display them in the content view. 

Once you have implemented these methods, make sure to test the application thoroughly to ensure that all the required features are working correctly."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

REQ5 User interface: Search and filter panel: Advanced search options for more precise filtering, including full-text search within documents.
REQ6 User interface: File preview window: A pop-up or sidebar window that provides a quick preview of the selected file. For text documents and images, show a preview within the window. For videos and audio files, provide basic playback controls.
REQ7 User interface: File preview window: Edit mode for text files, enabling users to make quick edits directly within the preview window.
REQ8 User interface: File properties and metadata editor: A dialog box that displays when a user selects "Properties" from the context menu of a file/folder. Shows detailed information including file size, creation/modification dates, and allows the user to edit metadata tags.
REQ9 User interface: Settings/Preferences Window: A separate window accessible from the main menu, allowing users to customize application settings. This includes theme selection (dark/light), default views, file organization rules, backup settings, and extension/plugin management.
REQ10 User interface: Tag management interface: A panel or window for creating, editing, and deleting tags. Users can also assign tags to files or folders from this interface, providing a flexible way to categorize and locate files quickly.
REQ11 User interface: Backup and synchronization setup wizard: A step-by-step wizard that guides users through setting up backup destinations (external drive, cloud storage) and synchronization options, including scheduling automatic backups.
REQ12 User interface: Help and tutorial section: A dedicated window or section accessible from the main menu, offering a searchable help database, user manual, and interactive tutorials on key features.
REQ13 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: The application must allow users to create customizable rules for automatically organizing files. These rules can be based on:
REQ14 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: File type (e.g., documents, images, music, videos).
REQ15 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: Date criteria (e.g., creation date, modification date).
REQ16 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: File name patterns (e.g., using wildcards or regular expressions).
REQ17 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: File size thresholds.
REQ18 File organization requirements: Automated organization rules: Users should be able to specify the target folder structure for organized files, with options to create new folders based on rule criteria (e.g., date, project name).
REQ19 File organization requirements: Manual tagging and categorization: Users must be able to assign custom tags to files and folders manually.
REQ20 File organization requirements: Manual tagging and categorization: The application should offer a tagging interface that suggests existing tags as the user types and allows the creation of new tags.
REQ21 File organization requirements: Manual tagging and categorization: Support for creating custom categories where users can group files/folders based on project, client, priority, or any other user-defined category.
REQ22 File organization requirements: Manual tagging and categorization: Users should be able to view and access files by tags and categories through a dedicated interface or filter.
REQ23 File organization requirements: Bulk file operations: The application must support bulk operations to rename, move, copy, or delete multiple files at once based on user selection.
REQ24 File organization requirements: Bulk file operations: Include options for bulk applying tags or moving files to a category, with undo functionality to revert changes if needed.
REQ25 File organization requirements: Folder and file management: Users must be able to create, rename, move, and delete files and folders from within the application.

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the `update_content_view` method, which is responsible for updating the content view with the given list of files. This method is called in the `refresh_view` and `perform_search` methods, but it is not defined in the code provided. To fix this, you need to implement the `update_content_view` method and add the necessary logic to update the content view with the list of files.

Here is a possible implementation of the `update_content_view` method:

```python
def update_content_view(self, files=None):
    '''
    Update the content view with the given list of files
    '''
    self.content_view.delete(*self.content_view.get_children())
    if files is None:
        files = []
    for file in files:
        if os.path.isdir(file):
            self.content_view.insert("", "end", text=file, tags=("folder",))
        else:
            self.content_view.insert("", "end", text=file, tags=("file",))
```

This implementation deletes all existing items in the content view and then inserts new items based on the given list of files. Directories are inserted with the "folder" tag, and files are inserted with the "file" tag.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the `update_content_view` method, which is responsible for updating the content view with the given list of files. This method is called in the `refresh_view` and `perform_search` methods, but it is not defined in the code provided. To fix this, you need to implement the `update_content_view` method and add the necessary logic to update the content view with the list of files.

Here is a possible implementation of the `update_content_view` method:

```python
def update_content_view(self, files=None):
    '''
    Update the content view with the given list of files
    '''
    self.content_view.delete(*self.content_view.get_children())
    if files is None:
        files = []
    for file in files:
        if os.path.isdir(file):
            self.content_view.insert("", "end", text=file, tags=("folder",))
        else:
            self.content_view.insert("", "end", text=file, tags=("file",))
```

This implementation deletes all existing items in the content view and then inserts new items based on the given list of files. Directories are inserted with the "folder" tag, and files are inserted with the "file" tag."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the `update_content_view` method. This method is responsible for updating the content view with the given list of files. It should delete the existing content view items and insert the new files as items in the content view. The files should be displayed with appropriate tags indicating whether they are folders or files. 

To fix this, you need to add the implementation of the `update_content_view` method. Here's an example of how it can be implemented:

```python
def update_content_view(self, files=None):
    '''
    Update the content view with the given list of files
    '''
    self.content_view.delete(*self.content_view.get_children())
    if files is None:
        files = []
    for file in files:
        if os.path.isdir(file):
            self.content_view.insert("", "end", text=file, tags=("folder",))
        else:
            self.content_view.insert("", "end", text=file, tags=("file",))
```

This implementation deletes all existing items in the content view using `self.content_view.delete(*self.content_view.get_children())`. Then, it iterates over the list of files and inserts each file as an item in the content view using `self.content_view.insert()`. The `tags` parameter is used to assign appropriate tags to the items indicating whether they are folders or files.

Once you have added the implementation of the `update_content_view` method, the code will be complete and will meet all the requirements specified by the user.

Then, it iterates over the list of files and inserts each file as an item in the content view using self.content_view.insert(). The tags parameter is used to assign appropriate tags to the items indicating whether they are folders or files.\n\nOnce you have added the implementation of the update_content_view method, the code will be complete and will meet all the requirements specified by the user.'} |

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the `update_content_view` method. This method is responsible for updating the content view with the given list of files. It should delete the existing content view items and insert the new files as items in the content view. The files should be displayed with appropriate tags indicating whether they are folders or files. 

To fix this, you need to add the implementation of the `update_content_view` method. Here's an example of how it can be implemented:

```python
def update_content_view(self, files=None):
    '''
    Update the content view with the given list of files
    '''
    self.content_view.delete(*self.content_view.get_children())
    if files is None:
        files = []
    for file in files:
        if os.path.isdir(file):
            self.content_view.insert("", "end", text=file, tags=("folder",))
        else:
            self.content_view.insert("", "end", text=file, tags=("file",))
```

This implementation deletes all existing items in the content view using `self.content_view.delete(*self.content_view.get_children())`. Then, it iterates over the list of files and inserts each file as an item in the content view using `self.content_view.insert()`. The `tags` parameter is used to assign appropriate tags to the items indicating whether they are folders or files.

Once you have added the implementation of the `update_content_view` method, the code will be complete and will meet all the requirements specified by the user."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

REQ2 User interface: Main window: A toolbar at the top with buttons for common actions (create new folder, delete file, refresh view, toggle between list/grid view, search bar). REQ3 User interface: Main window: Status bar at the bottom displaying information about the selected files/folders and general statistics (total files, total size). REQ4 User interface: Search and filter panel: A dedicated panel, accessible from the main window, allowing users to enter search criteria, choose filters (file type, date modified, size), and display results in a list or grid format. REQ5 User interface: Search and filter panel: Advanced search options for more precise filtering, including full-text search within documents. REQ6 User interface: File preview window: A pop-up or sidebar window that provides a quick preview of the selected file. For text documents and images, show a preview within the window. For videos and audio files, provide basic playback controls. REQ7 User interface: File preview window: Edit mode for text files, enabling users to make quick edits directly within the preview window. REQ8 User interface: File properties and metadata editor: A dialog box that displays when a user selects "Properties" from the context menu of a file/folder. Shows detailed information including file size, creation/modification dates, and allows the user to edit metadata tags. REQ9 User interface: Settings/Preferences Window: A separate window accessible from the main menu, allowing users to customize application settings. This includes theme selection (dark/light), default views, file organization rules, backup settings, and extension/plugin management.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: To specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly, you can create a requirements.txt file with the following content:
requirements.txt
```
tkinter==8.6
Pillow==8.4.0
```
In this case, the project requires the `tkinter` package for creating the graphical user interface and the `Pillow` package for image processing and preview capabilities. These dependencies can be installed using the `pip` package manager by running the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
