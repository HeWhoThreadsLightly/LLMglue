<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of several methods, such as `create_content_view`, `create_status_bar`, `perform_search`, `update_content_view`, and others. These methods are essential for the functionality of the application. Additionally, there are no comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each method, making it difficult to understand the code. 

To fix this, you need to implement the missing methods and add comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each method. This will improve the readability and maintainability of the code.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of several methods, such as `create_content_view`, `create_status_bar`, `perform_search`, `update_content_view`, and others. These methods are essential for the functionality of the application. Additionally, there are no comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each method, making it difficult to understand the code. 

To fix this, you need to implement the missing methods and add comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each method. This will improve the readability and maintainability of the code."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT>
The code is missing the implementation of several methods, such as `create_directory_tree`, `create_content_view`, `create_toolbar`, `create_status_bar`, `create_new_folder`, `delete_file`, `refresh_view`, `toggle_view`, `perform_search`, `update_directory_tree`, and `update_content_view`. These methods are essential for the functionality of the application and need to be implemented.

<SUGGESTION>
To fix this issue, you need to implement the missing methods in the `MainWindow` class. Each method should contain the necessary logic to perform the corresponding action, such as creating a new folder, deleting a file, refreshing the view, and updating the directory tree and content view. Make sure to add the necessary comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each method.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code is missing the implementation of several methods, such as `create_directory_tree`, `create_content_view`, `create_toolbar`, `create_status_bar`, `create_new_folder`, `delete_file`, `refresh_view`, `toggle_view`, `perform_search`, `update_directory_tree`, and `update_content_view`. These methods are essential for the functionality of the application and need to be implemented.

<SUGGESTION>
To fix this issue, you need to implement the missing methods in the `MainWindow` class. Each method should contain the necessary logic to perform the corresponding action, such as creating a new folder, deleting a file, refreshing the view, and updating the directory tree and content view. Make sure to add the necessary comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each method."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code is missing the implementation of several methods, such as `create_directory_tree`, `create_content_view`, `create_toolbar`, `create_status_bar`, `create_new_folder`, `delete_file`, `refresh_view`, `toggle_view`, `perform_search`, `update_directory_tree`, and `update_content_view`. These methods are essential for the functionality of the application.

<SUGGESTION>
To fix this issue, you need to implement the missing methods and ensure that they perform the intended functionality as described in the requirements. Additionally, make sure to add the necessary comments to explain the purpose and logic of each method."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: To specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly, you can create a requirements.txt file with the following content:
requirements.txt
```
tkinter==8.6
Pillow==8.3.1
```
In this example, we have included the tkinter package, which is required for creating the graphical user interface, and the Pillow package, which is used for image processing and displaying images in the application. You can add more dependencies to this file as per your project requirements. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

Programming Language: "{language}" Ideas: "{ideas}" Codes:  "{codes}" Requirements: "{requirements}" As the {assistant_role}, by using Markdown, you should write a manual.md file which is a detailed user manual to use the software, including introducing main functions of the software, how to install environment dependencies and how to use/play it. For example: manual.md ``` LangChain Building applications with LLMs through composability Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js. Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel. Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

FOCM allows users to create customizable rules for automatically organizing files. These rules can be based on file type, date criteria (creation date, modification date), file name patterns (using wildcards or regular expressions), and file size thresholds. Users can specify the target folder structure for organized files and create new folders based on rule criteria, such as date or project name. FOCM also supports manual tagging and categorization, where users can assign custom tags to files and folders manually. The application offers a tagging interface that suggests existing tags and allows the creation of new tags. Users can create custom categories to group files/folders based on project, client, priority, or any other user-defined category. FOCM provides bulk file operations for renaming, moving, copying, or deleting multiple files at once. Users can also apply tags or move files to a category in bulk, with undo functionality to revert changes if needed. FOCM supports folder and file management, allowing users to create, rename, move, and delete files and folders from within the application. A drag-and-drop interface is provided for moving files and folders into different categories or locations. The application also includes a feature to detect and resolve duplicate files based on name, size, and optionally content hash. Users can choose to keep, delete, or merge duplicate files.

## 11. Search and Filter
FOCM offers advanced search functionality, allowing users to search for files and folders using partial or full file names. The application also supports content-based search capabilities, enabling users to find files containing specific text, even within documents or metadata for images and videos. FOCM supports regular expressions (regex) in search queries for complex pattern matching. The application provides predefined filters to quickly select files based on common criteria, such as file type, size, and modification or creation date. Users can also create, save, and apply custom filter sets based on any combination of file attributes, including custom tags, project names, or specific content. FOCM integrates a tagging system where users can assign custom tags to files and folders and then search for these tags. The application supports hierarchical tags to facilitate detailed organization and searching. FOCM automatically saves recent searches for quick repetition and allows users to save frequently used search queries or filters for quick access. Search results in FOCM are sortable based on various criteria, such as name, size, date modified, and custom tags. Users can export search results to CSV or other formats for external use. Batch operations on search results are supported, allowing users to apply actions (move, delete, tag) to multiple files at once. Contextual actions are available in the search results, providing quick access to common file operations like open, rename, delete, move, or edit tags. Preview options for images, documents, and videos are directly available in the context menu. FOCM provides smart suggestions as users type in the search bar, offering suggestions based on their input, historical searches, and commonly accessed files. The application seamlessly integrates with the file organization system, allowing users to quickly organize search results into folders or tag groups directly from the search interface.

## 12. Additional Features
FOCM includes additional features to enhance content management. It provides preview capabilities for common file types, such as PDF, DOCX, images, and videos, directly within the application. Basic editing tools are available for text files and images, including text formatting and cropping. FOCM integrates with external applications for editing unsupported file types. The application also offers options to backup important files and folders to external drives or cloud storage services. Comprehensive documentation and help resources are available, including a user manual and online tutorials to demonstrate key features.

## 13. Accessibility
FOCM is designed with accessibility in mind. It supports keyboard navigation, allowing users to access full functionality via keyboard shortcuts. Tab navigation is implemented through all interactive elements in a logical order. Visual indicators are provided for the currently focused element. FOCM also includes screen reader support, making use of alt text to describe images, icons, and other non-textual elements.
