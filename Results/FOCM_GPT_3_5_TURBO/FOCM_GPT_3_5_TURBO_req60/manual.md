## 1. Installation
To install the File Organizer and Content Manager (FOCM), follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your computer. FOCM is developed using Python, so you need to have it installed to run the application.

2. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where you have downloaded the FOCM files.

3. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Once the installation is complete, you can launch FOCM by running the following command:

```
python main.py
```

## 2. Main Window
The main window of FOCM serves as the central hub of the application. It features a dual-pane layout, with one pane for the directory tree (folders) and another for viewing the contents of the selected directory. The main window also includes a toolbar at the top with buttons for common actions, such as creating a new folder, deleting a file, refreshing the view, toggling between list/grid view, and a search bar. At the bottom of the main window, there is a status bar displaying information about the selected files/folders and general statistics, such as the total number of files and total size.

## 3. Search and Filter Panel
FOCM provides a dedicated search and filter panel, accessible from the main window. This panel allows users to enter search criteria, choose filters (file type, date modified, size), and display the results in a list or grid format. The search and filter panel also offers advanced search options for more precise filtering, including full-text search within documents. Users can perform complex pattern matching using regular expressions (regex) in their search queries.

## 4. File Preview Window
FOCM includes a file preview window that provides a quick preview of the selected file. For text documents and images, the preview is shown within the window itself. For videos and audio files, basic playback controls are provided. The file preview window also supports an edit mode for text files, enabling users to make quick edits directly within the preview window.

## 5. File Properties and Metadata Editor
When a user selects "Properties" from the context menu of a file or folder, FOCM displays a dialog box that shows detailed information about the selected item. This includes file size, creation/modification dates, and other metadata. The user can also edit metadata tags using the file properties and metadata editor.

## 6. Settings/Preferences Window
FOCM provides a separate settings/preferences window accessible from the main menu. In this window, users can customize various application settings, including theme selection (dark/light), default views, file organization rules, backup settings, and extension/plugin management. The settings/preferences window allows users to tailor FOCM to their specific needs and preferences.

## 7. Tag Management Interface
FOCM offers a dedicated tag management interface where users can create, edit, and delete tags. Users can also assign tags to files or folders from this interface, providing a flexible way to categorize and locate files quickly. The tag management interface suggests existing tags as the user types and allows the creation of new tags. Users can also create custom categories to group files/folders based on project, client, priority, or any other user-defined category. The tag management interface provides an efficient way to view and access files by tags and categories through a dedicated interface or filter.

## 8. Backup and Synchronization Setup Wizard
FOCM includes a step-by-step wizard that guides users through setting up backup destinations (external drive, cloud storage) and synchronization options. The wizard allows users to schedule automatic backups and provides a seamless way to ensure the safety and availability of important files.

## 9. Help and Tutorial Section
FOCM offers a dedicated help and tutorial section accessible from the main menu. This section provides a searchable help database, user manual, and interactive tutorials on key features. Users can easily find answers to their questions and learn how to make the most of FOCM's capabilities.

## 10. File Organization
FOCM allows users to create customizable rules for automatically organizing files. These rules can be based on file type, date criteria (creation date, modification date), file name patterns (using wildcards or regular expressions), and file size thresholds. Users can specify the target folder structure for organized files and create new folders based on rule criteria, such as date or project name. FOCM also supports manual tagging and categorization, where users can assign custom tags to files and folders manually. The application offers a tagging interface that suggests existing tags and allows the creation of new tags. Users can create custom categories to group files/folders based on project, client, priority, or any other user-defined category. FOCM provides bulk file operations for renaming, moving, copying, or deleting multiple files at once. Users can also apply tags or move files to a category in bulk, with undo functionality to revert changes if needed. FOCM supports folder and file management, allowing users to create, rename, move, and delete files and folders from within the application. A drag-and-drop interface is provided for moving files and folders into different categories or locations. The application also includes a feature to detect and resolve duplicate files based on name, size, and optionally content hash. Users can choose to keep, delete, or merge duplicate files.

## 11. Search and Filter
FOCM offers advanced search functionality, allowing users to search for files and folders using partial or full file names. The application also supports content-based search capabilities, enabling users to find files containing specific text, even within documents or metadata for images and videos. FOCM supports regular expressions (regex) in search queries for complex pattern matching. The application provides predefined filters to quickly select files based on common criteria, such as file type, size, and modification or creation date. Users can also create, save, and apply custom filter sets based on any combination of file attributes, including custom tags, project names, or specific content. FOCM integrates a tagging system where users can assign custom tags to files and folders and then search for these tags. The application supports hierarchical tags to facilitate detailed organization and searching. FOCM automatically saves recent searches for quick repetition and allows users to save frequently used search queries or filters for quick access. Search results in FOCM are sortable based on various criteria, such as name, size, date modified, and custom tags. Users can export search results to CSV or other formats for external use. Batch operations on search results are supported, allowing users to apply actions (move, delete, tag) to multiple files at once. Contextual actions are available in the search results, providing quick access to common file operations like open, rename, delete, move, or edit tags. Preview options for images, documents, and videos are directly available in the context menu. FOCM provides smart suggestions as users type in the search bar, offering suggestions based on their input, historical searches, and commonly accessed files. The application seamlessly integrates with the file organization system, allowing users to quickly organize search results into folders or tag groups directly from the search interface.

## 12. Additional Features
FOCM includes additional features to enhance content management. It provides preview capabilities for common file types, such as PDF, DOCX, images, and videos, directly within the application. Basic editing tools are available for text files and images, including text formatting and cropping. FOCM integrates with external applications for editing unsupported file types. The application also offers options to backup important files and folders to external drives or cloud storage services. Comprehensive documentation and help resources are available, including a user manual and online tutorials to demonstrate key features.

## 13. Accessibility
FOCM is designed with accessibility in mind. It supports keyboard navigation, allowing users to access full functionality via keyboard shortcuts. Tab navigation is implemented through all interactive elements in a logical order. Visual indicators are provided for the currently focused element. FOCM also includes screen reader support, making use of alt text to describe images, icons, and other non-textual elements.
