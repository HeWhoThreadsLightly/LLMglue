<Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the implementation of the `generate_report_from_data` method in the `ReportsWindow` class. Currently, the method generates a report based on the columns present in the report data, but it does not correctly calculate the income and expenses for each category or month.

To fix this, you need to update the logic in the `generate_report_from_data` method to correctly calculate the income and expenses based on the report type. You can use the `groupby` function from pandas to group the data by category or month and then sum the amounts for each group. Additionally, you need to handle the case when the report type is not recognized and display an error message.

Here's an updated version of the `generate_report_from_data` method:

```python
def generate_report_from_data(self, report_data):
    columns = report_data.columns
    if "Category" in columns:
        report = report_data.groupby("Category")["Amount"].sum().reset_index()
        report["Type"] = ""
        report["Month"] = ""
        report["Income"] = 0
        report["Expenses"] = 0
    elif "Type" in columns:
        report = report_data.groupby("Type")["Amount"].sum().reset_index()
        report["Category"] = ""
        report["Month"] = ""
        report["Income"] = 0
        report["Expenses"] = 0
    elif "Month" in columns:
        report = report_data.copy()
        report["Category"] = ""
        report["Type"] = ""
        report["Income"] = 0
        report["Expenses"] = 0
    else:
        messagebox.showerror("Error", "Invalid report type.")
        return pd.DataFrame(columns=["Category", "Amount", "Type", "Month", "Income", "Expenses"])

    return report
```

With this fix, the `generate_report_from_data` method will correctly calculate the income and expenses for each category or month based on the report type.

Please make the necessary changes and update the code accordingly.

You can use the groupby function from pandas to group the data by category or month and then sum the amounts for each group. Additionally, you need to handle the case when the report type is not recognized and display an error message.\n\nHere\'s an updated version of the generate_report_from_data method:\n\npython\ndef generate_report_from_data(self, report_data):\n    columns = report_data.columns\n    if "Category" in columns:\n        report = report_data.groupby("Category")["Amount"].sum().reset_index()\n        report["Type"] = ""\n        report["Month"] = ""\n        report["Income"] = 0\n        report["Expenses"] = 0\n    elif "Type" in columns:\n        report = report_data.groupby("Type")["Amount"].sum().reset_index()\n        report["Category"] = ""\n        report["Month"] = ""\n        report["Income"] = 0\n        report["Expenses"] = 0\n    elif "Month" in columns:\n        report = report_data.copy()\n        report["Category"] = ""\n        report["Type"] = ""\n        report["Income"] = 0\n        report["Expenses"] = 0\n    else:\n        messagebox.showerror("Error", "Invalid report type.")\n        return pd.DataFrame(columns=["Category", "Amount", "Type", "Month", "Income", "Expenses"])\n\n    return report\n\n\nWith this fix, the generate_report_from_data method will correctly calculate the income and expenses for each category or month based on the report type.\n\nPlease make the necessary changes and update the code accordingly.'} |

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the implementation of the `generate_report_from_data` method in the `ReportsWindow` class. Currently, the method generates a report based on the columns present in the report data, but it does not correctly calculate the income and expenses for each category or month.

To fix this, you need to update the logic in the `generate_report_from_data` method to correctly calculate the income and expenses based on the report type. You can use the `groupby` function from pandas to group the data by category or month and then sum the amounts for each group. Additionally, you need to handle the case when the report type is not recognized and display an error message.

Here's an updated version of the `generate_report_from_data` method:

```python
def generate_report_from_data(self, report_data):
    columns = report_data.columns
    if "Category" in columns:
        report = report_data.groupby("Category")["Amount"].sum().reset_index()
        report["Type"] = ""
        report["Month"] = ""
        report["Income"] = 0
        report["Expenses"] = 0
    elif "Type" in columns:
        report = report_data.groupby("Type")["Amount"].sum().reset_index()
        report["Category"] = ""
        report["Month"] = ""
        report["Income"] = 0
        report["Expenses"] = 0
    elif "Month" in columns:
        report = report_data.copy()
        report["Category"] = ""
        report["Type"] = ""
        report["Income"] = 0
        report["Expenses"] = 0
    else:
        messagebox.showerror("Error", "Invalid report type.")
        return pd.DataFrame(columns=["Category", "Amount", "Type", "Month", "Income", "Expenses"])

    return report
```

With this fix, the `generate_report_from_data` method will correctly calculate the income and expenses for each category or month based on the report type.

Please make the necessary changes and update the code accordingly."

Here is a new customer's task: This desktop application is designed to help users manage their personal finances, including tracking income, expenses, and investments. It will provide an easy-to-use interface for entering financial transactions, categorizing them, and generating reports to understand spending habits and financial health.
REQ1 User interface requirement: Main windows and navigation: The application must feature a primary navigation menu or toolbar that allows users to switch between the main windows: Dashboard, Transactions, Reports, and Settings.
REQ2 User interface requirement: Main windows and navigation: A startup screen should present users with an overview of their financial summary, including the current balance, recent transactions, and upcoming bills.
REQ3 User interface requirement: Dashboard: The Dashboard should provide a quick overview of the user’s financial status, including total income, expenses for the current month, and a graph showing spending trends over the last six months.
REQ4 User interface requirement: Dashboard: Widgets or cards displaying critical information such as upcoming bills, budget summary, and investment performance should be customizable and rearrangeable by the user.
REQ5 User interface requirement: Transactions window: This window must allow users to view a list of all transactions, with filters to display transactions by date range, category, or income/expense type.
REQ6 User interface requirement: Transactions window: Users should be able to add a new transaction via a form that includes fields for the transaction date, amount, category (with a dropdown to select from predefined or custom categories), payment method, and optional notes.
REQ7 User interface requirement: Transactions window: Each transaction in the list should have options to edit or delete, accessible via context menu or buttons.
REQ8 User interface requirement: Reports window: The Reports window should offer various reports on financial data, including spending by category, income vs. expenses over time, and monthly comparison charts.
REQ9 User interface requirement: Reports window: Users should be able to select the report type from a dropdown menu, specify the date range, and filter by categories or income/expense type for more detailed analysis.
REQ10 User interface requirement: Reports window: Reports should be visualized through charts and graphs, with the ability to export the report to PDF or image formats for sharing or printing.
REQ11 User interface requirement: Settings window: In the Settings window, users must be able to adjust application preferences such as default currency, date format, application theme (light or dark mode), and notification preferences for reminders about bills and recurring transactions.
REQ12 User interface requirement: Settings window: This window should also include options for data backup and restore, including exporting and importing the financial database in CSV format.
REQ13 User interface requirement: Login and security: Upon launching the application, users should be greeted with a login screen to ensure that financial data is protected. The login screen should include fields for a password.
REQ14 User interface requirement: Login and security: For data storage, consider using SQLite and encrypt the database with the users password when the app is closed.
REQ15 User interface requirement: Login and security: The application should also provide a logout option accessible from the main navigation or user profile menu, allowing users to secure their session when not in use..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

You can use the groupby function from pandas to group the data by category or month and then sum the amounts for each group. Additionally, you need to handle the case when the report type is not recognized and display an error message.\n\nHere\'s an updated version of the generate_report_from_data method:\n\npython\ndef generate_report_from_data(self, report_data):\n    columns = report_data.columns\n    if "Category" in columns:\n        report = report_data.groupby("Category")["Amount"].sum().reset_index()\n        report["Type"] = ""\n        report["Month"] = ""\n        report["Income"] = 0\n        report["Expenses"] = 0\n    elif "Type" in columns:\n        report = report_data.groupby("Type")["Amount"].sum().reset_index()\n        report["Category"] = ""\n        report["Month"] = ""\n        report["Income"] = 0\n        report["Expenses"] = 0\n    elif "Month" in columns:\n        report = report_data.copy()\n        report["Category"] = ""\n        report["Type"] = ""\n        report["Income"] = 0\n        report["Expenses"] = 0\n    else:\n        messagebox.showerror("Error", "Invalid report type.")\n        return pd.DataFrame(columns=["Category", "Amount", "Type", "Month", "Income", "Expenses"])\n\n    return report\n\n\nWith this fix, the generate_report_from_data method will correctly calculate the income and expenses for each category or month based on the report type.\n\nPlease make the necessary changes and update the code accordingly.'} |

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the implementation of the `generate_report_from_data` method in the `ReportsWindow` class. Currently, the method is returning an empty DataFrame when an invalid report type is selected. However, the method should handle this case by displaying an error message to the user and returning a valid DataFrame with appropriate columns.

To fix this, you can modify the `generate_report_from_data` method as follows:

```python
def generate_report_from_data(self, report_data):
    # Add logic to generate the report from the fetched data
    # Example code:
    columns = report_data.columns
    if "Category" in columns:
        report = report_data.groupby("Category")["Amount"].sum().reset_index()
        report["Type"] = ""
        report["Month"] = ""
        report["Income"] = 0
        report["Expenses"] = 0
    elif "Type" in columns:
        report = report_data.groupby("Type")["Amount"].sum().reset_index()
        report["Category"] = ""
        report["Month"] = ""
        report["Income"] = 0
        report["Expenses"] = 0
    elif "Month" in columns:
        report = report_data.copy()
        report["Category"] = ""
        report["Type"] = ""
        report["Income"] = 0
        report["Expenses"] = 0
    else:
        messagebox.showerror("Error", "Invalid report type.")
        return pd.DataFrame(columns=["Category", "Amount", "Type", "Month", "Income", "Expenses"])
    return report
```

This modification ensures that an error message is displayed when an invalid report type is selected, and a valid DataFrame with appropriate columns is returned for valid report types.

Please make this change in the `ReportsWindow` class and verify that the application functions as expected.

        messagebox.showerror("Error", "Invalid report type.")
        return pd.DataFrame(columns=["Category", "Amount", "Type", "Month", "Income", "Expenses"])
    return report
```

This modification ensures that an error message is displayed when an invalid report type is selected, and a valid DataFrame with appropriate columns is returned for valid report types.

Please make this change in the `ReportsWindow` class and verify that the application functions as expected.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the implementation of the `generate_report_from_data` method in the `ReportsWindow` class. Currently, the method is returning an empty DataFrame when an invalid report type is selected. However, the method should handle this case by displaying an error message to the user and returning a valid DataFrame with appropriate columns.

To fix this, you can modify the `generate_report_from_data` method as follows:

```python
def generate_report_from_data(self, report_data):
    # Add logic to generate the report from the fetched data
    # Example code:
    columns = report_data.columns
    if "Category" in columns:
        report = report_data.groupby("Category")["Amount"].sum().reset_index()
        report["Type"] = ""
        report["Month"] = ""
        report["Income"] = 0
        report["Expenses"] = 0
    elif "Type" in columns:
        report = report_data.groupby("Type")["Amount"].sum().reset_index()
        report["Category"] = ""
        report["Month"] = ""
        report["Income"] = 0
        report["Expenses"] = 0
    elif "Month" in columns:
        report = report_data.copy()
        report["Category"] = ""
        report["Type"] = ""
        report["Income"] = 0
        report["Expenses"] = 0
    else:
        messagebox.showerror("Error", "Invalid report type.")
        return pd.DataFrame(columns=["Category", "Amount", "Type", "Month", "Income", "Expenses"])
    return report
```

This modification ensures that an error message is displayed when an invalid report type is selected, and a valid DataFrame with appropriate columns is returned for valid report types.

Please make this change in the `ReportsWindow` class and verify that the application functions as expected."

You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: This desktop application is designed to help users manage their personal finances, including tracking income, expenses, and investments. It will provide an easy-to-use interface for entering financial transactions, categorizing them, and generating reports to understand spending habits and financial health.
REQ1 User interface requirement: Main windows and navigation: The application must feature a primary navigation menu or toolbar that allows users to switch between the main windows: Dashboard, Transactions, Reports, and Settings.
REQ2 User interface requirement: Main windows and navigation: A startup screen should present users with an overview of their financial summary, including the current balance, recent transactions, and upcoming bills.
REQ3 User interface requirement: Dashboard: The Dashboard should provide a quick overview of the user’s financial status, including total income, expenses for the current month, and a graph showing spending trends over the last six months.
REQ4 User interface requirement: Dashboard: Widgets or cards displaying critical information such as upcoming bills, budget summary, and investment performance should be customizable and rearrangeable by the user.
REQ5 User interface requirement: Transactions window: This window must allow users to view a list of all transactions, with filters to display transactions by date range, category, or income/expense type.
REQ6 User interface requirement: Transactions window: Users should be able to add a new transaction via a form that includes fields for the transaction date, amount, category (with a dropdown to select from predefined or custom categories), payment method, and optional notes.
REQ7 User interface requirement: Transactions window: Each transaction in the list should have options to edit or delete, accessible via context menu or buttons.
REQ8 User interface requirement: Reports window: The Reports window should offer various reports on financial data, including spending by category, income vs. expenses over time, and monthly comparison charts.
REQ9 User interface requirement: Reports window: Users should be able to select the report type from a dropdown menu, specify the date range, and filter by categories or income/expense type for more detailed analysis.
REQ10 User interface requirement: Reports window: Reports should be visualized through charts and graphs, with the ability to export the report to PDF or image formats for sharing or printing.
REQ11 User interface requirement: Settings window: In the Settings window, users must be able to adjust application preferences such as default currency, date format, application theme (light or dark mode), and notification preferences for reminders about bills and recurring transactions.
REQ12 User interface requirement: Settings window: This window should also include options for data backup and restore, including exporting and importing the financial database in CSV format.
REQ13 User interface requirement: Login and security: Upon launching the application, users should be greeted with a login screen to ensure that financial data is protected. The login screen should include fields for a password.
REQ14 User interface requirement: Login and security: For data storage, consider using SQLite and encrypt the database with the users password when the app is closed.
REQ15 User interface requirement: Login and security: The application should also provide a logout option accessible from the main navigation or user profile menu, allowing users to secure their session when not in use..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

It will provide an easy-to-use interface for entering financial transactions, categorizing them, and generating reports to understand spending habits and financial health. REQ1 User interface requirement: Main windows and navigation: The application must feature a primary navigation menu or toolbar that allows users to switch between the main windows: Dashboard, Transactions, Reports, and Settings. REQ2 User interface requirement: Main windows and navigation: A startup screen should present users with an overview of their financial summary, including the current balance, recent transactions, and upcoming bills. REQ3 User interface requirement: Dashboard: The Dashboard should provide a quick overview of the user’s financial status, including total income, expenses for the current month, and a graph showing spending trends over the last six months.

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the implementation of the `generate_report_from_data` method in the `ReportsWindow` class. Currently, the method is returning an empty DataFrame when an invalid report type is selected. However, the method should handle this case by displaying an error message to the user and returning a valid DataFrame with appropriate columns.

To fix this, you can modify the `generate_report_from_data` method as follows:

```python
def generate_report_from_data(self, report_data):
    # Add logic to generate the report from the fetched data
    # Example code:
    columns = report_data.columns
    if "Category" in columns:
        report = report_data.groupby("Category")["Amount"].sum().reset_index()
        report["Type"] = ""
        report["Month"] = ""
        report["Income"] = 0
        report["Expenses"] = 0
    elif "Type" in columns:
        report = report_data.groupby("Type")["Amount"].sum().reset_index()
        report["Category"] = ""
        report["Month"] = ""
        report["Income"] = 0
        report["Expenses"] = 0
    elif "Month" in columns:
        report = report_data.copy()
        report["Category"] = ""
        report["Type"] = ""
        report["Income"] = 0
        report["Expenses"] = 0
    else:
        messagebox.showerror("Error", "Invalid report type.")
        return pd.DataFrame(columns=["Category", "Amount", "Type", "Month", "Income", "Expenses"])
    return report
```

This updated code will display an error message if an invalid report type is selected and return a valid DataFrame with appropriate columns.

```

This updated code will display an error message if an invalid report type is selected and return a valid DataFrame with appropriate columns.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the implementation of the `generate_report_from_data` method in the `ReportsWindow` class. Currently, the method is returning an empty DataFrame when an invalid report type is selected. However, the method should handle this case by displaying an error message to the user and returning a valid DataFrame with appropriate columns.

To fix this, you can modify the `generate_report_from_data` method as follows:

```python
def generate_report_from_data(self, report_data):
    # Add logic to generate the report from the fetched data
    # Example code:
    columns = report_data.columns
    if "Category" in columns:
        report = report_data.groupby("Category")["Amount"].sum().reset_index()
        report["Type"] = ""
        report["Month"] = ""
        report["Income"] = 0
        report["Expenses"] = 0
    elif "Type" in columns:
        report = report_data.groupby("Type")["Amount"].sum().reset_index()
        report["Category"] = ""
        report["Month"] = ""
        report["Income"] = 0
        report["Expenses"] = 0
    elif "Month" in columns:
        report = report_data.copy()
        report["Category"] = ""
        report["Type"] = ""
        report["Income"] = 0
        report["Expenses"] = 0
    else:
        messagebox.showerror("Error", "Invalid report type.")
        return pd.DataFrame(columns=["Category", "Amount", "Type", "Month", "Income", "Expenses"])
    return report
```

This updated code will display an error message if an invalid report type is selected and return a valid DataFrame with appropriate columns."

You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: This desktop application is designed to help users manage their personal finances, including tracking income, expenses, and investments. It will provide an easy-to-use interface for entering financial transactions, categorizing them, and generating reports to understand spending habits and financial health.
REQ1 User interface requirement: Main windows and navigation: The application must feature a primary navigation menu or toolbar that allows users to switch between the main windows: Dashboard, Transactions, Reports, and Settings.
REQ2 User interface requirement: Main windows and navigation: A startup screen should present users with an overview of their financial summary, including the current balance, recent transactions, and upcoming bills.
REQ3 User interface requirement: Dashboard: The Dashboard should provide a quick overview of the user’s financial status, including total income, expenses for the current month, and a graph showing spending trends over the last six months.
REQ4 User interface requirement: Dashboard: Widgets or cards displaying critical information such as upcoming bills, budget summary, and investment performance should be customizable and rearrangeable by the user.
REQ5 User interface requirement: Transactions window: This window must allow users to view a list of all transactions, with filters to display transactions by date range, category, or income/expense type.
REQ6 User interface requirement: Transactions window: Users should be able to add a new transaction via a form that includes fields for the transaction date, amount, category (with a dropdown to select from predefined or custom categories), payment method, and optional notes.
REQ7 User interface requirement: Transactions window: Each transaction in the list should have options to edit or delete, accessible via context menu or buttons.
REQ8 User interface requirement: Reports window: The Reports window should offer various reports on financial data, including spending by category, income vs. expenses over time, and monthly comparison charts.
REQ9 User interface requirement: Reports window: Users should be able to select the report type from a dropdown menu, specify the date range, and filter by categories or income/expense type for more detailed analysis.
REQ10 User interface requirement: Reports window: Reports should be visualized through charts and graphs, with the ability to export the report to PDF or image formats for sharing or printing.
REQ11 User interface requirement: Settings window: In the Settings window, users must be able to adjust application preferences such as default currency, date format, application theme (light or dark mode), and notification preferences for reminders about bills and recurring transactions.
REQ12 User interface requirement: Settings window: This window should also include options for data backup and restore, including exporting and importing the financial database in CSV format.
REQ13 User interface requirement: Login and security: Upon launching the application, users should be greeted with a login screen to ensure that financial data is protected. The login screen should include fields for a password.
REQ14 User interface requirement: Login and security: For data storage, consider using SQLite and encrypt the database with the users password when the app is closed.
REQ15 User interface requirement: Login and security: The application should also provide a logout option accessible from the main navigation or user profile menu, allowing users to secure their session when not in use..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

You are Counselor. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include asking what user and customer think and provide your valuable suggestions. 
Here is a new customer's task: This desktop application is designed to help users manage their personal finances, including tracking income, expenses, and investments. It will provide an easy-to-use interface for entering financial transactions, categorizing them, and generating reports to understand spending habits and financial health.
REQ1 User interface requirement: Main windows and navigation: The application must feature a primary navigation menu or toolbar that allows users to switch between the main windows: Dashboard, Transactions, Reports, and Settings.
REQ2 User interface requirement: Main windows and navigation: A startup screen should present users with an overview of their financial summary, including the current balance, recent transactions, and upcoming bills.
REQ3 User interface requirement: Dashboard: The Dashboard should provide a quick overview of the user’s financial status, including total income, expenses for the current month, and a graph showing spending trends over the last six months.
REQ4 User interface requirement: Dashboard: Widgets or cards displaying critical information such as upcoming bills, budget summary, and investment performance should be customizable and rearrangeable by the user.
REQ5 User interface requirement: Transactions window: This window must allow users to view a list of all transactions, with filters to display transactions by date range, category, or income/expense type.
REQ6 User interface requirement: Transactions window: Users should be able to add a new transaction via a form that includes fields for the transaction date, amount, category (with a dropdown to select from predefined or custom categories), payment method, and optional notes.
REQ7 User interface requirement: Transactions window: Each transaction in the list should have options to edit or delete, accessible via context menu or buttons.
REQ8 User interface requirement: Reports window: The Reports window should offer various reports on financial data, including spending by category, income vs. expenses over time, and monthly comparison charts.
REQ9 User interface requirement: Reports window: Users should be able to select the report type from a dropdown menu, specify the date range, and filter by categories or income/expense type for more detailed analysis.
REQ10 User interface requirement: Reports window: Reports should be visualized through charts and graphs, with the ability to export the report to PDF or image formats for sharing or printing.
REQ11 User interface requirement: Settings window: In the Settings window, users must be able to adjust application preferences such as default currency, date format, application theme (light or dark mode), and notification preferences for reminders about bills and recurring transactions.
REQ12 User interface requirement: Settings window: This window should also include options for data backup and restore, including exporting and importing the financial database in CSV format.
REQ13 User interface requirement: Login and security: Upon launching the application, users should be greeted with a login screen to ensure that financial data is protected. The login screen should include fields for a password.
REQ14 User interface requirement: Login and security: For data storage, consider using SQLite and encrypt the database with the users password when the app is closed.
REQ15 User interface requirement: Login and security: The application should also provide a logout option accessible from the main navigation or user profile menu, allowing users to secure their session when not in use..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel. Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
