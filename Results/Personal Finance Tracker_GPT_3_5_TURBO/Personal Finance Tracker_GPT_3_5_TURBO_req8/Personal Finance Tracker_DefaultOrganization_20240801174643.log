As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: This desktop application is designed to help users manage their personal finances, including tracking income, expenses, and investments. It will provide an easy-to-use interface for entering financial transactions, categorizing them, and generating reports to understand spending habits and financial health.
REQ1 User interface requirement: Main windows and navigation: The application must feature a primary navigation menu or toolbar that allows users to switch between the main windows: Dashboard, Transactions, Reports, and Settings.
REQ2 User interface requirement: Main windows and navigation: A startup screen should present users with an overview of their financial summary, including the current balance, recent transactions, and upcoming bills.
REQ3 User interface requirement: Dashboard: The Dashboard should provide a quick overview of the user’s financial status, including total income, expenses for the current month, and a graph showing spending trends over the last six months.
REQ4 User interface requirement: Dashboard: Widgets or cards displaying critical information such as upcoming bills, budget summary, and investment performance should be customizable and rearrangeable by the user.
REQ5 User interface requirement: Transactions window: This window must allow users to view a list of all transactions, with filters to display transactions by date range, category, or income/expense type.
REQ6 User interface requirement: Transactions window: Users should be able to add a new transaction via a form that includes fields for the transaction date, amount, category (with a dropdown to select from predefined or custom categories), payment method, and optional notes.
REQ7 User interface requirement: Transactions window: Each transaction in the list should have options to edit or delete, accessible via context menu or buttons.
REQ8 User interface requirement: Reports window: The Reports window should offer various reports on financial data, including spending by category, income vs. expenses over time, and monthly comparison charts..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT>
In the `TransactionsWindow` class, the `update_transaction_data` method is missing the logic to update the transaction data in the application. Currently, it only creates a `transaction_data` dictionary but does not update the `self.master.transaction_data` list with the new transaction data.

To fix this, you should add the following line of code at the end of the `update_transaction_data` method:

```
self.master.transaction_data.append(transaction_data)
```

This will ensure that the new transaction data is added to the `self.master.transaction_data` list.

Once you make this change, the `TransactionsWindow` class will correctly update the transaction data in the application.

Please make this revision and ensure that the `update_transaction_data` method updates the transaction data in the application.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
In the `TransactionsWindow` class, the `update_transaction_data` method is missing the logic to update the transaction data in the application. Currently, it only creates a `transaction_data` dictionary but does not update the `self.master.transaction_data` list with the new transaction data.

To fix this, you should add the following line of code at the end of the `update_transaction_data` method:

```
self.master.transaction_data.append(transaction_data)
```

This will ensure that the new transaction data is added to the `self.master.transaction_data` list.

Once you make this change, the `TransactionsWindow` class will correctly update the transaction data in the application.

Please make this revision and ensure that the `update_transaction_data` method updates the transaction data in the application."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the methods in the `DashboardWindow` class. Specifically, the methods `generate_report`, `fetch_report_data`, `generate_report_from_data`, and `display_report` are missing. These methods are required to generate and display the financial reports in the Reports window. 

To fix this, you need to add the missing methods in the `DashboardWindow` class and implement the necessary logic to generate and display the reports. You can refer to the existing code in the `ReportsWindow` class as an example for implementing these methods.

Once you have implemented the missing methods, the software will be able to generate and display the financial reports in the Reports window, fulfilling the user's requirement.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the methods in the `DashboardWindow` class. Specifically, the methods `generate_report`, `fetch_report_data`, `generate_report_from_data`, and `display_report` are missing. These methods are required to generate and display the financial reports in the Reports window. 

To fix this, you need to add the missing methods in the `DashboardWindow` class and implement the necessary logic to generate and display the reports. You can refer to the existing code in the `ReportsWindow` class as an example for implementing these methods.

Once you have implemented the missing methods, the software will be able to generate and display the financial reports in the Reports window, fulfilling the user's requirement."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: This desktop application is designed to help users manage their personal finances, including tracking income, expenses, and investments. It will provide an easy-to-use interface for entering financial transactions, categorizing them, and generating reports to understand spending habits and financial health.
REQ1 User interface requirement: Main windows and navigation: The application must feature a primary navigation menu or toolbar that allows users to switch between the main windows: Dashboard, Transactions, Reports, and Settings.
REQ2 User interface requirement: Main windows and navigation: A startup screen should present users with an overview of their financial summary, including the current balance, recent transactions, and upcoming bills.
REQ3 User interface requirement: Dashboard: The Dashboard should provide a quick overview of the user’s financial status, including total income, expenses for the current month, and a graph showing spending trends over the last six months.
REQ4 User interface requirement: Dashboard: Widgets or cards displaying critical information such as upcoming bills, budget summary, and investment performance should be customizable and rearrangeable by the user.
REQ5 User interface requirement: Transactions window: This window must allow users to view a list of all transactions, with filters to display transactions by date range, category, or income/expense type.
REQ6 User interface requirement: Transactions window: Users should be able to add a new transaction via a form that includes fields for the transaction date, amount, category (with a dropdown to select from predefined or custom categories), payment method, and optional notes.
REQ7 User interface requirement: Transactions window: Each transaction in the list should have options to edit or delete, accessible via context menu or buttons.
REQ8 User interface requirement: Reports window: The Reports window should offer various reports on financial data, including spending by category, income vs. expenses over time, and monthly comparison charts..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the `SettingsWindow` class. To fix this, you need to add the necessary code to the `settings.py` file to implement the `SettingsWindow` class. This class should have a similar structure to the other window classes, with a title, geometry, and a button for saving settings. Once the `SettingsWindow` class is implemented, you should be able to switch to the Settings window using the navigation menu.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the `SettingsWindow` class. To fix this, you need to add the necessary code to the `settings.py` file to implement the `SettingsWindow` class. This class should have a similar structure to the other window classes, with a title, geometry, and a button for saving settings. Once the `SettingsWindow` class is implemented, you should be able to switch to the Settings window using the navigation menu."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: This desktop application is designed to help users manage their personal finances, including tracking income, expenses, and investments. It will provide an easy-to-use interface for entering financial transactions, categorizing them, and generating reports to understand spending habits and financial health.
REQ1 User interface requirement: Main windows and navigation: The application must feature a primary navigation menu or toolbar that allows users to switch between the main windows: Dashboard, Transactions, Reports, and Settings.
REQ2 User interface requirement: Main windows and navigation: A startup screen should present users with an overview of their financial summary, including the current balance, recent transactions, and upcoming bills.
REQ3 User interface requirement: Dashboard: The Dashboard should provide a quick overview of the user’s financial status, including total income, expenses for the current month, and a graph showing spending trends over the last six months.
REQ4 User interface requirement: Dashboard: Widgets or cards displaying critical information such as upcoming bills, budget summary, and investment performance should be customizable and rearrangeable by the user.
REQ5 User interface requirement: Transactions window: This window must allow users to view a list of all transactions, with filters to display transactions by date range, category, or income/expense type.
REQ6 User interface requirement: Transactions window: Users should be able to add a new transaction via a form that includes fields for the transaction date, amount, category (with a dropdown to select from predefined or custom categories), payment method, and optional notes.
REQ7 User interface requirement: Transactions window: Each transaction in the list should have options to edit or delete, accessible via context menu or buttons.
REQ8 User interface requirement: Reports window: The Reports window should offer various reports on financial data, including spending by category, income vs. expenses over time, and monthly comparison charts..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
